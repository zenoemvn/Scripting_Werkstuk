Many people (me included) here are from maths and informatics. The way we (learned to) attack a problem starts with Step 0: Understand all definitions. So we start by looking up the definition of ""plagiarism"" and work with that.

However, many people do not so. If you ever taught a inteoductory math class, you will know the problem: The students have to solve an exercise which is virtually just looking",2019-02-20T21:58:35.497,104735,

15057,4854,1,You raise an extremely important point. I have found very similar strangeness on the Stack Forums. There is often a small group of heavy users who flock to new questions and scrutinize them. They often can justify their claims but don't seem to understand that when you scrutinize someone everyone loses. They come across rational but often have thousands of points on the forum which makes for lots of leeway to be police-like without concern for losing status. The cold rational personality can also be passive aggressive in such circumstances which makes the OP actively angry.,2021-01-15T23:46:32.497,67964,
15058,336,0,"Very good question. In fact I feel that this forum can work more or less what you are asking about but sadly the rules are over-enforced.  The rules are good in themselves but like any society, when they are over-done they become burdensome and destructive to higher-potential. New contributors also are discouraged once they walk into the wall of rules and the peculiar culture thereby creating a top-heavy organization.
