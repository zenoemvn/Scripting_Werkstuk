He has a Ph.D in Philosophy from The University of New South Wales in addition to a MS &amp; BS in Information Technology from the Rochester Institute of Technology.</p>

<p>He has developed a new methodology (The Social Data Flow Network) to explore how individuals in the field understand the nature of data. Currently, his research is exploring the social construction of technology, focusing on the user-driven change of technological tools, in addition to his research of data warehouse ETL strategies for disparate data sets.</p>

<p>Beyond philosophy, Dr. Ballsun-Stanton has experience in haptic research, specifically the use of gesture control of human computer interfaces and an abiding interest in robotics as seen in his flying robotic cable-array manta-ray.</p>

<p>His interests include the academic study of Role-Playing games, the exploration of how science fiction literature transforms reality, and the social consequences of a technological world outpacing society's cultural assimilation of its consequences.</p>

<p>He is a long time gamer, having helped to design the indie game Pax Draconis. He has been running an Ars Magica game for the last 6 years and has extensive experience with indie games and both 3.5 and 4e D&amp;D.</p>

<p>Feel free to stalk my Internet name(s) if you wish - it's how I make most of my closest contacts these days. Just note that I don't really believe in social constructs when they get in the way of satisficing (or in the way of my goal of learning as much as possible).</p>
<p>Don't take anything I say/do too seriously.  A lot of the things I do (that may look weird/stupid on the outside) are the types of things that help me adjust my posterior probability of various things - especially low probability events.Sometimes I hit on a jackpot/very interesting idea. I'm kind of messy since it helps facilitate creative destruction.</p>
<p>I have <em>a lot</em> of respect for <em>all</em> of the sciences. Tactically, I'm developing heuristics for rationality, impartiality, anti-laziness, and creation+identification+searching for what's relevant+reliable. Strategically, I just want to learn everything.</p>
<p>A lot of my thought processes involve my creating new hypotheses and refuting them on my own. I still document the thought process since it's important and may be important for future &quot;true&quot; hypotheses.</p>

This blend of research and development is the type of work which motivates and excites me the most. Currently, I am working on <a href=""https://carp.cachet.dk/core/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a distributed platform which enables researchers to conduct biometric research</a> 'in the wild' (outside of the lab environment).</p>
<p>As part of my previous research, I developed a fully functional system (called <a href=""http://whatheco.de/laevo/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Laevo</a>), exploring an alternative to the prevalent, antiquated, desktop computing paradigm. This work (and related publications) contributes to a line of research called 'activity-centric computing'.</p>
<p>I have over 10 years of professional software development experience. Prior to academia, I worked for several years as a professional full-stack software developer at a game development company in Belgium: <a href=""http://www.aimproductions.be/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">AIM Productions</a>. I immediately started working here after a successful internship concluding my bachelor degree in 2007. My job entailed working on interactive hometrainer software and other multimedia applications. This spiked my interest in user interface development. I liked the work and colleagues at the company too much to give up entirely for further studies, so I decided to combine the two. In 2009 I started studying for my master in Game and Media Technology at the <a href=""https://www.uu.nl/en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">University of Utrecht</a> in the Netherlands, from which I graduated in 2012.</p>

<p>[Welcome to TeX.SE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/1436/welcome-to-tex-sx). </p>

<p>It is <em>always</em> best to compose a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/228/ive-just-been-told-i-have-to-write-a-minimal-example-what-is-that) that illustrates the problem including the `\documentclass` and the appropriate packages so that those trying to help don't have to recreate it.</p>

<p>This will also serve as a test case and ensure that the solution actually works for you.</p>

<p>That way those trying to help can focus on solution as opposed to setting up the problem test case.</p>

<p>While code snippets are useful in explanations, it is <em>always</em> best to compose a fully compilable [MWE](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/questions/228/ive-just-been-told-i-have-to-write-a-minimal-example-what-is-that) that illustrates the problem including the `\documentclass` and the appropriate packages so that those trying to help don't have to recreate it.</p>

<p>Personally, I have often solved my own problems in the process of reducing the amount of code actually required to reproduce the problem.</p>

<p>A tip: If you indent lines by 4 spaces, then they're marked as a code sample. You can also highlight the code and click the ""code"" button (`{}`).</p>

<p>I took the liberty to format you post a little. See [this link for more details on available formatting](http://meta.tex.stackexchange.com/editing-help).</p>

<p>In this case it will actually help to ensure that the solution actually solves your specific problem.</p>

I have done research on applications of simplicial complexes to tetrahedron packing and contact number problems in sphere packings, non-standard models of Peano arithmetic, diagonal distance in quantum error correcting codes, asymptotic combinatorics of modal frames and game theory applications, nilpotent orbit varieties, and bicyclic convex 4-polytopes. I also defined a sequent calculus for dynamic topological logic, wrote a computational chemistry paper introducing the notion of Benzene aromarings, am collaborating with physicists on a black hole physics paper, and am founding a photovoltaic systems engineering company ""SolarCube"". I am also currently writing a book on the Geometric Analysis of Convex Bodies which studies the theory of rectification, the connection between elliptic curves and lattice packings, non-congruent sphere packing kissing numbers, homothetic translative covering problems, totally separable sphere packings, and the Mahler conjecture. I recently received a grant to research Applied Discrete Geometry (crystallography of solid state battery electrolytes) in the Department of Chemistry at the University of Calgary and am starting a Masters degree in the fall under the supervision of Karoly Bezdek and Clifton Cunningham.</p>

<p>Once you have experienced flight in mathematical skies,
you will forever walk the Earth with your eyes turned skyward,
for there you have been, and there you will always long to return.</p>
<p>The facts of mathematics are verified and presented by the axiomatic method. One must guard, however, against confusing the <em>presentation</em> of mathematics with the <em>content</em> of mathematics. An axiomatic presentation of a mathematical fact differs from the fact that is being presented as medicine differs from food. It is true that this particular medicine is necessary to keep mathematicians at a safe distance from the self-delusions of the mind. Nonetheless, understanding mathematics means being able to forget the medicine and enjoy the food. - Gian-Carlo Rota, <em>Indiscrete Thoughts</em>.</p>

<p>My childhood was spent on DOS and Windows 95. After learning to read, I managed to learn the basics of programming with the help of <a href=""http://www.angelfire.com/nh/secret/#guide"" rel=""nofollow"">The Secret Guide to Computers</a>, GWBASIC, <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">UCBLogo</a>, LADYBUG Logo, and some LOGO book(s) I can't recall the names of. I didn't much like GWBASIC, but at least it had a printed reference manual. I had also tried QBASIC, but had trouble with the online help, which I later decided was probably because all of the text was in the same font (making it hard to tell the verbatim code from the other notation).</p>

<p>[... Windows, VB, DJGPP, Cygwin, Mindstorms, POV-RAY ...]</p>

<p>Eventually I bought my own computer and installed a copy of Linux, and that's when I really began to learn how computer systems work: technical documentation for most things was available online, and if that wasn't enough to satisfy my curiosity I could look at the source code.</p>

Next on my bucket list is to learn quantum field theory though that is turning out to be a challenge! I hang around <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/71/the-h-bar"">in the chat room</a> and I'm happy to answer questions there as well. Just ping me if you want my attention.</p>

After a hiatus of some Word years I returned to LaTeX and have never looked back. I now try to implement all my documentation in LaTeX including university versions of beamer, beamerposter and letterheads (the U does not provide anything but Word templates).</p>
<p>LaTeX spawned my interest in type setting and I have spent time type setting books among others a popular science book on Glaciology. As Editor in Chief of an international journal I am working in collaboration with a professional LaTeX expert on implementing a LaTeX template for manuscripts and proof-ready layout. As head of graduate studies I am also trying to influence graduate students to work with LaTeX.</p>

<p>One of my hobby projects is developing PopTrayU (<a href=""http://poptrayu.sourceforge.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poptrayu.sourceforge.net</a>), an open source email notifier written in Delphi. I had been using the original PopTray for about 10 years, and decided to learn enough Delphi to fix a couple pet bugs, since no one else seemed to have the knowledge, time, and inclination to do it themselves, and there hadn't been a new version released in over 7 years. Once I'd fixed that one bug, there was one more little thing I thought I could improve, and wouldn't it be fun if I could make this aspect of the application a little more customizable? And then there's that other bug...well, someday I'll get them all fixed, maybe :)</p>

<h3>FAQ:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Why download the complete TeX distribution?  It's so big!</li>
<li>I'm on Linux.  Why install 'vanilla' TeX Live when my package repositories already contain it?</li>
</ul>

<p>Believe me, unless you <em>really</em> know what you're doing, it's always simpler to just download the full, vanilla TeX Live from TUG.  Space is cheap – your time is not.  Don't believe me?</p>

That is I am particularly interested in building computationally and cognitively plausible models of how we learn and communicate about the world, and how to get computers/robots to learn and communicate about the world in a similar way, as well as how better to teach people languages and about language. </p>

<p>From the perspective of learning, my focus is on unsupervised learning - children learn to speak without a teacher, without being taught what nouns and verbs are.  From the perspective of language, I like Tagmemics and Cognitive Linguistics - consistent with my focus on unsupervised learning, language and learning boil down to what we think is similar.  </p>

<p>Formally this gives rise to similarity or distance measures used in learning, and we also need to account chance levels or prevalences.  It also gives rise to metaphor, metonymy, grammar and related linguistic constructs, which define Cognitive Linguistics, as well as the basic ideas of Phonemic and Tagmemic analysis, Contrast in Analogous Environments and Complementary Distribution.  It similarly explains the richness of polysemy and why there is really no such thing as synonymy, as when anything is different we look for other things to be different to learn from, using the part that is similar as context or paradigm, a substrate for the learning.  We are continuously developing and modifying the range of meaning of language with our personal, social and cultural development, as we press old words or morphemes into new roles.</p>

<p>I also edit the new Springer journal, Computational Cognitive Science that aims to bridge the gap between Computational Intelligence and Cognitive Science.</p>

<p>I'm a former grad student in statistics and psychometrics, at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands. My research interests laid with the development and use of mathematical models of human behavior, and the role of memory as a theoretical bridge point between perception and action. While there's no love lost between institutional science and myself, I kept my unsavory love for Bayes factors and dynamical systems theory.</p>

So dear sinner, with all love even in LaTeX: is He your personal Savior? If not you are in utter danger, but I am glad to tell you that in Him there is hope as He never rejects a broken sinner, seriously troubled with his sins. Come to Him with all of your burdens, but you can ever trust Him Who is Mighty to Save.
Repent, not relying on yourself but on His perfect and finished work on the Cross at Calvary, and believe in the gospel, even today, for the Kingdom of God (Jesus Christ) is at hand.</p>

<p>I am an experienced professional actively seeking an exciting new project in the field of artificial intelligence, drones, or any other fun and innovative domain. I have a strong background in working remotely and I am open to relocating anywhere globally for the right opportunity.</p>
<p>My current focus revolves around chatgpt prompt engineering and automation. I possess expertise in Scala, Python, JavaScript, as well as data engineering, embedded systems and Scrum methodologies. With a PhD in Computer Science from EPFL Switzerland and a Master's degree in Telecommunications Systems from Barcelona, I bring a wealth of academic knowledge and practical skills to the table. As a team player, I thrive in collaborative environments and excel in delivering high-quality results.</p>
<p>Having lived in various countries, I bring a diverse cultural perspective to my work. I have spent 20 years in Barcelona, 20 years in Switzerland, one year in Asia (India, Nepal, and Indonesia), and three years in South America (Brazil, Ecuador, and Bolivia).</p>
<p>In addition to my professional pursuits, I have a deep passion for pushing boundaries. I can effortlessly adapt to living an intense social life with luxury, as well as adopting the minimalist lifestyle of a backpacker with no possessions. Communication is another aspect of my life where I appreciate both ends of the spectrum. While I can engage in lively conversations and articulate my thoughts extensively, I have also explored the practice of Vipassana meditation lasting up to 30 days, where I practice noble silence and abstain from speaking. I also practice water fastings lasting up to 21 days. I enjoy going hiking and camping alone for extended periods. Getting lost and facing my fears in such situations has allowed me to grow and learn valuable lessons along the way, and I've learned about discipline and resilience.</p>
<p>I have also devoted three years to the practice of shamanism, working with sacred plant medicines such as Ayahuasca and San Pedro. These transformative experiences have had a profound impact on my personal growth, expanding my mind, intuition, and creativity. They have opened doors to new perspectives, allowing me to approach challenges with a fresh and inspired mindset. This hunger fuels my passion and dedication, both in my personal life and professional pursuits. I believe that love and a genuine connection with others are fundamental aspects of a fulfilling existence.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out to me at david.portabella@gmail.com to discuss potential opportunities further. You can also find more information about my professional background and achievements on my LinkedIn profile at <a href=""http://www.linkedin.com/in/dportabella"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.linkedin.com/in/dportabella</a>. Additionally, you can access my code repositories on GitHub at <a href=""https://github.com/dportabella"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/dportabella</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for considering my profile, and I look forward to connecting with you.</p>

<p>Since Stack Exchange has effectively turned my profile page into a political platform without my foreknowledge or consent, I feel obligated to share my own views:</p>

<p>An oligarchy of five justices setting policy for the entire USA is not the government the Constitution guarantees, and it's not the one we want.  Not everything President Gerald Ford said was very smart or worth repeating, but this is</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A government big enough to give you everything you want is a government big enough to take from you everything you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The USA was designed as a Constitutional Republic, with checks-and-balances between the branches of the federal government, and also division of power between federal state and local governments.  (And these are explicitly required by the plain language of the Constitution)  All government officials need to stay within the authority granted to them by the Constitution, especially when that means they can't do whatever they want.</p>

I'm an avid consumer of science fiction, with a special soft spot for all things cyberpunk. Oh, and I just recently began reading comics. Better late than never, right?</p>

<p>Vladimir Putin has not only invaded Ukraine, but he has begun an assault on the people in Ukraine's capital, Kiev.</p>
<p>Ukraine is viewed by the international community as entirely the victim in the current situation.</p>
<p>The entire free world is lining up against you.</p>
<p>Now imagine what is happening in Kiev as happening in Moscow - but instead of sending poorly armed and trained children to die, they are just sending missiles and bombs of all sizes.</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, you must take to the streets or any channel you have the most influence with, and do everything in your power to contribute to the removal of Vladimir Putin.</p>
<p>Warmly and Sincerely,</p>
<p>Aaron Hall</p>
<p>Russian Translation via Google Translate:</p>
<h1>Дорогие русские люди</h1>
<p>Владимир Путин не только вторгся в Украину, но и начал наступление на людей в столице Украины Киеве.</p>
<p>Украина рассматривается международным сообществом исключительно как жертва сложившейся ситуации.</p>
<p>Весь свободный мир выстраивается против вас.</p>
<p>А теперь представьте, что происходит в Киеве, как это происходит в Москве - только вместо того, чтобы посылать на смерть плохо вооруженных и обученных детей, они просто посылают ракеты и бомбы всех размеров.</p>
<p>Чтобы этого не произошло, вы должны выйти на улицу или на любой канал, на который вы имеете наибольшее влияние, и сделать все, что в ваших силах, чтобы способствовать смещению Владимира Путина.</p>
<p>Тепло и искренне,</p>

Since joining, I have been working on the design and prototype of an enhanced smart contract system with a functional programming attitude.</p>

<p>Before becoming a programmer, I was a mathematician for a long time. I received my PhD from Harvard in geometric representation theory with Dennis Gaitsgory as my advisor. Afterward, I was a postdoc at the University of Michigan, ending in May 2015, when I left academia and became a programmer. Although I'm fairly highly educated in category theory, which you might think is related to my interest in Haskell, in fact, I don't use the connection very much in practice. The language is simply beautiful in its own right.</p>

<p>In academia, my only programming experience was with the macro/functional/awful language TeX, for which I wrote a few small packages, most notably ytabeau and the unpublished trace-pgfkeys (available on my website). Compared to writing TeX, nothing else is that bad.</p>

<p>""The kind of knowledge which is supported only by observations and is not yet proved must be carefully distinguished from the truth; it is gained by induction, as we usually say. Yet we have seen cases in which mere induction led to error. Therefore, we should take great care not to accept as true such properties of the numbers which we have discovered by observation and which are supported by induction alone. Indeed, we should use such discovery as an opportunity to investigate more exactly the properties discovered and to prove or disprove them; in both cases we may learn something useful.""</p>

  <p>Technically, it was a branch of metamathematics, usually called
  metamathics. Metamathics; the investigation of the properties of
  Realities (more correctly, Reality-fields) intrinsically unknowable by
  and from their own, but whose general principles could be hazarded at.</p>
  
  <p>Metamathics led to everything else, it led to the places that nobody
  else had ever seen or heard of or previously imagined. . . . It was
  like a drug; an ultimately liberating, utterly enhancing,
  unadulterably beneficial, overpoweringly glorious drug for the
  intellect of machines as far beyond the sagacity of the human mind as
  they were beyond its understanding.</p>
  
  <p>This was the way the Minds spent their time. They imagined entirely
  new universes with altered physical laws, and played with them, lived
  in them and tinkered with them, sometimes setting up the conditions
  for life, sometimes just letting things run to see if it would arise
  spontaneously, sometimes arranging things so that life was impossible
  but other kinds and types of bizarrely fabulous complications were
  enabled.</p>
  
  <p>Some of the universes possessed just one tiny but significant
  alteration, leading to some subtle twist in the way things worked,
  while others were so wildly, aberrantly different it could take a
  perfectly first-rate Mind the human equivalent of years of intense
  thought even to find the one tenuously familiar strand of recognizable
  reality that would allow it to translate the rest into
  comprehensibility. Between those extremes lay an infinitude of
  universes of unutterable fascination, consummate joy and absolute
  enlightenment. All that humanity knew and could understand, every
  single aspect, known, guessed at and hoped for in and of the universe
  was a like a mean and base mud hut compared to the vast, glittering
  cloud-high palace of monumentally exquisite proportions and prodigious
  riches that was the metamathical realm. Within the infinities raised
  to the power of infinities that those metamathical rules provided, the
  Minds built their immense pleasure domes of rhapsodic philosophical
  ecstasy.</p>
  
  <p>That was where they lived. That was their home. When they weren't
  running ships, meddling with alien civilizations or planning the
  future course of the Culture itself, the Minds existed in those
  fantastic virtual realities, sojourning beyondward into the
  multidimensional geographies of their unleashed imaginations,
  vanishingly far away from the single limited point that was reality.</p>
  
  <p>The Minds had long ago come up with a proper name for it; they called
  it the Irreal, but they thought of it as Infinite Fun. That was what
  they really knew it as, The Land of Infinite Fun.</p>
  
  <p>It did the experience pathetically little justice.</p>

<p>I'm a senior full-stack software engineer with years of experience in Web, Apps, RESTful APIs and Microservices development. My current tech stack consists primarily of HTML5/JS (React, Typescript) for web development, microservices on AWS Lambda (Node.js and C#), and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Over the years I've worked with a multitude of technologies: ASP.NET, Android/iOS development, Xbox One and Windows 10 Apps (Both XAML and HTML based ones), Java and so on.</p>
<hr />
<h3>What I do for fun</h3>
<p>I volunteer in environment &amp; sustainability groups in my local area (if you're into that sort of stuff, you should join <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/"">Sustainable Living SE</a>!)</p>
<p>I enjoy many video, board and card games; I very, VERY occasionally upload gaming clips to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9C2jWUstGzt89083JsGqQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube</a>. I enjoy achievement hunting, especially for achievements that make you approach a situation differently (e.g. beating a boss with only melee attacks) - it's good fun to come up with different strategies, and it's a good excuse to revisit older games.</p>
<p>I run a D&amp;D campaign, and regularly play in other campaigns and/or one-night stories. Here's a short <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cJCCNuc1mw&amp;list=PLr5zfvGepa2H0WK8CxXGYN5H87zFN_VLa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Star Wars campaign</a> my friend hosted for a bit, I play a Droid called TA-1, check it out!</p>

<p>The act of Programming is indeed thinking. The pure act of Typing is just materializing of what has been thought. Of course, there is a bidirectional feedback connection between writing and thinking. At least for introverts; dunno about extroverts :) And given that, I disagree with @MisterPositive: Of course the typing part needs to be paid, too - a master stone sculptor gets not only paid for planning the sculpture, but also for liberating the sculpture from the stone.</p>

<p>Many of these fancy web-design fads of the last years may be neat to look at the first few times, be it caroussels, infinite scroll, lazy loading or even (shriek) horizontal layouts, but then they suck from a user's point of view. E.g., with lazy loading one gets different results for incremental search, depending on how much has been scrolled over; crazyness. Also, many of those magick apparatuses destroy conversion rates, something that seems to not exist for a perceived 95%+ majority of webdesigners.

<p>Also: I really recommend to strike &quot;why don't they use X, yet&quot;, &quot;why do they still use X&quot; and all variants thereof (regex: <code>(still|allready)?.*(use|using).*(yet)?</code>) from your list of idioms. I always get frightened when hearing that, because it's often enough a red flag indicating blind faith in something. &quot;Yo brother, work for us, we're already using .net, you know&quot; was something I heard quite often 10 years ago.

direct and open way which can be quite unnerving especially if you personally

<em>yes</em>, ""No"" means <em>no</em>, do not try to find hidden depths in the conversation.

it as personal attack. The easiest thing to cope with it is to imagine me
like a computer.</p>

by taking my own conclusions and experience gathered from other people. So some
earnest answers may clash with your preference for answers who sound good.

not arrive at the conclusion that I actually follow or condone behavior described

<p>Adding an additional answer even if there are valid answers can still add value to the collection of answers and questions we are building here. (A late answer does, by it's nature, get not much attention, so it leads to exceptionally low reputation per answer. But hey, that's life, right?)
And I feel it's the important thing here: We're answering professional questions in a professional way, and often do that quickly. That's of great value for the general public.</p>
<p>But the real thing of value, that is of value hard to describe in simple terms, is the body of text, the whole collection that we are creating here together. All participants here, whether he or she cares more about asking, answering or collecting questions and answers.</p>

<h2>Project 1: The Sphere</h2>
<p>The mission of <em>The Sphere</em> is to promote self-refection, the respect to others, the curiosity to what causes fear, and the courage to cut harmful things. The targets are people who are suffering (or creating suffering to others), yet resist others' supports to maintain status quo. This includes abusers and people who developed a worldview to justify their learned helplessness. The method is to equip their friends and loved ones the skills and knowledge to help them change their mind. For starter, read about <a href=""https://www2.slideshare.net/esahakyan/integrated-social-services-reaching-the-most-vulnerable-training-package-for-case-managers-16096590"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">social work case management</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">consequentialism</a>.</p>
<p>Protectors of autonomy usually have a misconception that one's choice should always be respected, because their autonomy should always be respected. The fact is that it is only true in 99.999999% of cases, and the other 0.0000001% is people who internalized oppression. Therefore, only hoping for the best but leaving their situation intact is generally considered as undermining their autonomy. For starter, read about <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-autonomy"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">relational autonomy</a> and <a href=""https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/decision-capacity"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decision-making capacity</a>.</p>
<p>This project is written in Vietnamese. <a href=""https://xn--qucu-hr5aza.com/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%2Academia%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=Homepage&amp;utm_campaign=Homepage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Its website</a> attracted ~30k people in past year (~160 on average per day). Many of them are human right activists, psychologists, religion practitioners, academic researchers, artists, etc.</p>
<h2>Project 2: A theory of perspective</h2>
<p>Imagine a floating iceberg. The part above the water is the <em>The Sphere</em> project. The part below the water is this project. It is to construct a theory for the concept &quot;perspective&quot;, as in &quot;keep a fresh perspective&quot;, &quot;look at the problem in a new perspective&quot;, &quot;put yourself in other's perspective&quot;, etc. The concept is intuitive, but exactly what it is is still vague. Because of that, these advices are easier said than done. The take-home message is this &quot;formula&quot;:</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>Challenging assumption = meaning shifting = perspective changing</h3>
</blockquote>
<p>For more detail you can read the <a href=""https://lyminhnhat.com/research-proposal/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%2Academia%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=Research%20proposal&amp;utm_campaign=Perspectives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">research proposal</a>. You can also read <a href=""https://lyminhnhat.com/a-theory-of-perspective-full-text/?utm_source=SE%20%C2%BB%2Academia%20Profile&amp;utm_medium=A%20theory%20of%20perspective&amp;utm_campaign=Perspectives"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the theory itself</a>, but I should warn you that this is not a final product.</p>
<p>Thank you for your visit, and I hope you enjoy them. Have a nice day.</p>

A few years later I applied these skill to write my first ‘database’ application for the Salida youth crisis relief center. The application used VB6 and flat files on an FTP server to mimic a real database. Around the same time I wrote my first game, a two player top-down shooter. A year later I rewrote the database application in C#, now using a real database (MySQL) which allowed users to really work together. This application is still used daily by approximately 20 people at Stichting Cardan.</p>
<p>Since 2008 I started focusing on games. In 2008 I discovered Microsoft’s XNA framework (a managed DirectX wrapper for PC, Xbox and Windows Phone). Since then I’ve been an active member of the XNA community. While I was learning the framework and general game development techniques I started keeping <a href=""http://roy-t.nl"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a blog</a>. At this blog I periodically post tutorials and code snippets. I also wrote a few tutorials for popular XNA sites like <a href=""http://www.ziggyware.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.ziggyware.com</a> (now defunct) and <a href=""http://madgamedev.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">www.sgtconker.com</a> (renamed to MadGameDev). With these tutorials I won a couple of prizes.</p>
<p>In 2010 I met a few game designers and artists working on the game <a href=""http://www.hollandiagame.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hollandia</a>. They had just won a Dutch Game Award but their programmer was unable to continue working on the game engine, which caused the project to stall. I rewrote most of their engine and coupled it to an existing physics framework. Around the same time I worked with a 15 man strong team on an extensive web shop project for Q-Free. We developed a process that automatically pulled new releases from source control and integrated them into our web shop.</p>
<p>While finishing up my Bsc. in Computing Science I worked at Science LinX (2009-2012) where I grew from a system administrator to serious game developer with a diverse set of responsibilities, from building exhibits to managing projects.</p>
<p>January 2015 I graduated Cum Laude and I now poses a master's degree from Utrecht University. During my master I also I interned at Abbey Games (creators of Reus). After that I worked SilverFit where I used the Kinect camera to help the elderly recover or stay fit.</p>
<p>Currently I work at the Dutch e-tailer Bol.com as an expert engineer and cloud liaison.</p>

<p>Moderator  ♦  on [English Language and Usage](http://english.stackexchange.com) and Pro Tem ♦ on [Portuguese Language](http://portuguese.stackexchange.com).  I can most easily be reached in real time by pinging me in the [ELU chatroom](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/95/english-language-usage).
<p>I’m Tom Christiansen, co-author of <em>Programming Perl</em> and <em>Perl Cookbook</em> from O’Reilly. I work for <a href=""http://www.grantstreet.com/careers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Grant Street Group</a>, who are always looking to <strong>hire more Perl programmers</strong>. I can (sometimes) be reached via email at &lt;tchrist53147@gmail.com&gt;, but that address is heavily spam-filtered so just because you sent me something doesn’t guarantee that I’ll’ve read it. I’ve lived in Colorado for the last quarter century, but have previously lived abroad in Spain and England. I try to spend as much time as I can in the Colorado mountains.</p>
<p>I’ve been doing Unix and C programming since the early 1980s. My programming interests include high-level languages, Unicode, regexes, and operating systems. My old <a href=""http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/407"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">O’Reilly bio</a> from ages ago mutters various ancient things about me, and some folks have gone and put up <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Christiansen"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a silly Wikipedia page</a> about me, too. As a kid I lived down the street from <a href=""http://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/8.10/cruise_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Gary Gygax</a> of Dungeons and Dragons fame, and worked for TSR throughout high school. I have ancient undergraduate degrees in Spanish and in Computer Science, plus a graduate degree in compsci focusing on operating systems design and in natural language processing. I’ve studied Spanish, French, Italian, Portuguese, Latin, and German, along with a smattering of related languages thrown in.</p>
<p>The maxim that <em>“If you haven’t lost track of how many languages you’ve learned, you haven’t learned enough of them yet”</em> applies to both programming languages and natural languages alike.</p>

I find it satisfying to implement ideas in mathematically-optimized computer code, whether for PDE numerical analysis, 24/7 scalable web server software, or HTML 5 apps. I truly enjoy programming in almost any computer language so long as both the language itself is efficient and the language also grants me the ability to be efficient by allowing me full control over enhancing the algorithms and operations involved. I passed the milestone of writing one million lines of code over 13 years ago and haven't been counting since then.</p>

<p>Coding can become tiresome on rare occasions when creativity is not invited to the task at hand. I therefore consider it a blessing that I can spend the rest of my time each day tutoring and lecturing at universities, because I never get tired of teaching and helping others.</p>

<p>As a side-job, I have tens of thousands of hours' experience in professional photography and writing.  My research interests are influenced by the imaging problems related to photography, in particular image recovery and more efficient ways of representing images in less space and with higher quality. I love a good algorithm, but more than all, I love Jesus, the Creator of all.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In the Code of Conduct, we state “We don’t tolerate any language
likely to offend or alienate people based on race, gender, sexual
orientation, or religion — and those are just a few examples.” To
clarify, this includes discussion questioning or debating the
legitimacy of someone’s race, gender, sexual orientation or religion.
Further, the debate or discussion of whether or not you want to or
should use a person’s pronouns is both offensive and alienating.</p>

<p>is totally offensive and alienating to me.</p>
<p>Which is irrelevant, of course. Speech acts cannot be made immoral based on how someone is likely to feel as a result of those acts. They can only be rendered immoral by a narrow range of things, such as the intention to lie or deceive, or if they're outright threats that go beyond the (ethically permissible) threat of refusing to cooperate in future.</p>
<p>The problem with this new policy is not that I find it both offensive and alienating. The problem is that it ignores basic principles of morality, and mandates the imposition of an incredibly stupid and destructive circle of beliefs about right and wrong. SO has done a very bad thing here. By deciding to make ethically permissible speech acts (e.g. those that question gender ideology) contrary to the official rules, SO renders itself guilty of moral wrongdoing, not because droves of people object to these policies, but rather because the policies are immoral.</p>
<p>For me, and for many others, this is the final straw. We were already disappointed with previous attempts at forcing a very specific worldview on users. Now that the problem has gotten worse, we're leaving.</p>

<p>If you have a concern that pertains to moderation on either of those sites and would like to speak with me in private, feel free to flag a post (preferably a related one to your concern, but flagging your own post will do if that doesn't apply) using the ""Other..."" reason and I or one of my fellow moderators can open a private chat room for us.</p>

<p>My amateur radio call sign is KF7WLP.</p>

<p>I've been programming since I was eight, working on several projects during that time, some for fun and some for pay (which, you know, is also fun). I'm now dev lead at Haugen Applications, a company my father founded a while back in Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>

<p>I tend to take the ""a little knowledge about a lot of things"" route in computer science, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to new technologies so I find I can get the hang of fairly advanced topics in little enough time that I can pretend I know what I'm talking about. With that said, I currently have no formal training in CS so most of what I know is from experience and reading. My working rule of thumb is that I'd rather be able to go to university without student loans and for fun than do it because I'm supposed to and find myself in huge amounts of debt and at the same job when I get out.</p>

<p>Day-to-day, I use C# and T-Sql mostly with some JavaScript here and there. I also have working proficiency in Java and C++, and I'm probably forgetting a few in the mix. Most of what I do these days is web-related, both through writing websites and writing (and on some rare occasions, reading) APIs. I used to live and breathe Windows Forms, but something magical happened at some point in my life and I moved on from them.</p>

<p>Seeing the results of approaching a problem with the right fundamentals, I’ve understood that it is the surest way to prevent problems from arising in the first place. Since new users ask the most fundamental questions, answering their questions is most fascinating.</p>
<p>Other than this, I also like to understand the ‘Why’ behind the decision Apple makes. The stories that unfold make me look at things differently. For that reason, you will find me following my curiosity and asking some very fundamental questions on AskDifferent.</p>

I feel a strong sense of fragility every time I break out the credit card and buy a domain name.  And watching elected moderators fall by the wayside over arguments over put-your-pronouns-in-your-profile makes me wonder if it's an accident that stackoverflow overtook <code>expertsexchange.com</code> (ha ha, expert sex change, wait, was that a joke in the first place?).  How can these petty human issues destroy our collective knowledge about programming?  What's with the status war over gender pronouns?  Not like I knew who Monica was before, but how the hell did Shog9 get fired?  How did this happen?  And it's kind of like seeing how weak the entirety of the world is by virtue of electing Trump, we are all way...way...too...hackable.)</p>
<p>Eh.  Or, as I used to say: &quot;Not actually &quot;hostile&quot;, just a bit irate.  :)&quot;</p>
<p><em>(A &quot;hostile fork&quot;--as many developers know--refers to when open source efforts diverge due to different ideas about where the code should be taken.  I started my site intending to get to the bottom of &quot;why we all can't just get along&quot; as a bit of an SEO/keyword hack.  It worked...try googling &quot;hostile fork&quot;.)</em></p>
<p>Until I figure out how to make everyone bring the best ideas to the table, I'm just blogging about software development.  Long term I hope that people searching for &quot;hostile fork x&quot; will find my site and consider engagement instead of forking.  Yet somehow it's easier to answer StackOverflow questions than make people get along.  Who knew?</p>

<p>I enjoy using my experience to help others. That is why I am active at a number of <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/10806/torben-gundtofte-bruun?tab=accounts"">other sites</a> in the StackExchange network on topics that interest me. </p>

<p><a href=""http://stackexchange.com/users/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd""><img src=""http://se-flair.appspot.com/png/235c7dd1f1bb4049ac1e0f6c70b8d1cd"" alt=""valuable flair!""></a> </p>

<p>I'm something of a Swiss army knife both professionally and in private, able to juggle a wild variety of things at once. I've worked in every kind of business that uses software. I'm also very good with tools, both IT and mechanic. Whether you need software design or assembling some IKEA furniture, I'm your man for the job. I'm generally soft-spoken but driven by clear principles.</p>

<p>I'm a twin, I've lived in five countries, I speak four languages fluently and two more embarrassingly. Also, being a father routinely develops my patience which is useful for moderating on StackExchange too. </p>

<p>I'm an economist by training. I've used LaTeX since 1991, ever since I wrote a couple of working papers with an early version of LaTeX. I continue to use LaTeX for my own working papers, journal articles, and some of my other professional publications.</p>
<p>I am the principal author of the <a href=""http://ctan.org/pkg/selnolig"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">selnolig package</a>, which lets LuaLaTeX users automatically suppress typographic ligatures that are inappropriate because they span morpheme boundaries, for both English and German language texts.</p>
<p>I once edited an entire conference proceedings volume in LaTeX. This was a fabulous learning experience, especially as I got to work closely with a professional book designer from a very early stage of the editing and publication process. For another organization I used to work for, I wrote a LaTeX package to implement the style and layout requirements the organization had chosen to impose on working papers written by its professional staff (mostly its economists). This package (i) helped free up much of the authors' time that would otherwise have been wasted on figuring out how to implement the organization's stylistic requirements in LaTeX -- the guidelines had been written (unsurprisingly...) primarily for users of MS Word -- and (ii) actually convinced some of the organization's economists to make the switch from MS Word to LaTeX in order to write their working papers more efficiently.</p>

<p>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” - Beckett</p>
<p>If I see further than most, it is because I have stood on the toes of giants and they kicked me high into the air...</p>
<p>However, there is nothing to suggest that I see further than most.</p>
<p>I am (inasmuch as one 'is' an occupation) an engineer. My mathematical skills are rather pedestrian, with a rare insight every now and then. I have been lucky enough to sit in the same room with some famous mathematicians &amp; engineers. My Erdős number is 5, which undoubtedly makes me as unique as an Irishman in a pub. And I have been spotted in The Pub from time to time.</p>
<p>In professional circumstances, my value add has usually been the injection of common sense and completion of grunt work when perspectives and energies are unfocused.</p>
<p>My current age is the largest number less than or equal to the Social Security retirement age that has six divisors. (GPT-3.5 can't handle this!)</p>
<p>My real name is Joe Higgins. Apparently, my last name means 'of the Viking' in Irish.</p>
<p>My alma mater is University College, Cork in Ireland, and I had the additional privilege of obtaining my Phd. in EECS from the University of California at Berkeley under the enlightened tutelage of Lucien Polak.</p>
<p>I can be reached at joe dot higgins at gmail dot com.</p>
<p>The little picture is of my tent at Lake Helen on the beautiful Mount Shasta in August, 2009. Unfortunately I had to turn back near the peak this time (on the appropriately named Misery Hill) because of a lightning storm which dumped some
unexpected snow. The nearby lightning caused my ice axe to hum and a strange bee-like
buzzing sound in my hair! Very entertaining.</p>
<p>Feynman used to say, &quot;physics is to sex as mathematics is to masturbation&quot;.</p>
<p>To cheer you up, AE Housman wrote that
&quot;Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.&quot;</p>
<p>I like Rockafellar's line: &quot;This classical result is an outstanding example of a fact which is completely obvious to geometric intuition, but which wields important algebraic content and is not trivial to prove.&quot; (&quot;Convex Analysis&quot;, commentary before Theorem 19.1.)</p>
<p>Another line I like, from Charles Pugh's &quot;Real Mathematical Analysis&quot;: &quot;Complex analysis is the good twin and real analysis the evil one: beautiful formulas and elegant theorems seem to blossom spontaneously in the complex domain, while toil and pathology rule the reals.&quot; (Charles was on my qualifying exam committee.)</p>

<p>I'm a hobby game developer, currently working on an experimental C# game framework called Flare, which aims to automate the tasks that I and others commonly do for every project, such as opening a window or getting input in a platform-independent way. Flare provides OpenGL 3+ core bindings, but not compatibility bindings so supports OpenGL 3.0 and upwards, with the default context being 3.2 core. It also provides an optional XNA-like sprite rendering system as well as a 2D text rendering system.</p>

<p>I have experience with programming languages including C#, C/C++, Ruby, Java, and Python, and a passing acquaintance with several others. I also have experience with technologies including XNA/MonoGame, Unity, Ruby on Rails, FRC/FTC robotics libraries (WPILib and the FTC SDK), as well as the afore-mentioned OpenGL and some mobile development.</p>

<p>I currently attend high school in the United States.</p>

<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am a Computer Science M. Sc. student (they/them). My research interests are knowledge representation and processing of math, and lately also programming language theory.</p>
<p>I contribute to the <a href=""https://uniformal.github.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MMT project</a> (<a href=""https://github.com/UniFormal/MMT"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UniFormal/MMT on GitHub</a>), a larger research software written in Scala which lets you formalize a broad range of formal knowledge: math, logic, type theory, and foundations. MMT and many of its algorithms are <a href=""https://kwarc.info/people/frabe/Research/rabe_future_15.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">foundation-independent</a>: with bare MMT, you don't even have natural numbers, let alone functions. The beauty is versatility; the challenge generality.</p>
<p>For more info and publications, see my <a href=""https://kwarc.info/people/nroux/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">academic website</a> and <a href=""https://navid-roux.netlify.app/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">personal website</a>.</p>
<p>More hobby-wise, I am dabbling in the <a href=""https://coq.inria.fr/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Coq Proof Assistant</a> and, e.g., formalized my own flavor of <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/basic-ontology-language"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">an ontology language</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/lambda-coq"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a lambda calculus with de Bruijn indices</a>.</p>
<p>Programming-wise, I also fancy the latest TypeScript/ECMAScript. And I like <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/mmtpygments"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">writing/autogenerating syntax highlighters</a> that <a href=""https://comfreek.github.io/mmtpygments/mmtpygments/test/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">succeed on over 15k lines of code</a>.</p>
<p>Feel free to reach out (by posting an <a href=""https://github.com/ComFreek/ComFreek/issues/new"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">issue here</a>)! I always love hearing and chatting about cool things.</p>

<p>When using a personal pronoun to refer to me in English, I prefer the pronoun he/him/his. I will not feel offended if you use <em>himself</em>, <em>his greatness</em>, <em>sir</em>, or another pronoun of your choice. But really, I have better things to do than worry about whether someone uses ""preferred"" gender pronouns instead of the singular ""they"" which has persisted as a natural gender-neutral pronoun in English since the 14th century.</p>

<p>I am currently suspended for a year on Meta. A suspension awarded 11 November, 2022. I read this comment on a <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/383855/"">Windows-Phone statement</a>: <code>Judging from her activity here on Meta.SE, and the end date of her suspension, it would appear she's serving a year-long suspension that was only applied last week, nearly a year since the last visible activity on that question. There's no visible correlation between the two. – @XXX</code></p>
<p>That is inaccurate. In 2021 I was suspended for one month because of a Windows-Phone question I'd posted, and my attempt to strike up an honest and sincere discussion. I've been tip-toeing on SE ever since, but in 2022 two comments attracted the ire of users who saw fit to flag them. Comments which were devoid of hate, prejudice, or animosity. No foul language, vulgarity, obscenity, or mean-spirited sentiment was expressed. The first comment was in support of a heavily downvoted post, and its author, illustrating a paradoxical situation. Meanwhile, a dismissive comment—untouched–sneered at the OP's legitimate query.</p>
<p>But <em>my</em> comments did not–and I quote–“spark joy”.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“…we do feel your heart is in the right place but at this point a longer one [suspension] might be in order.”</p>
<p>I'm not going trot out the code of conduct, but implicitly our rules have always been &quot;Be Nice&quot; - and the above comments were not.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The two culpable comments are:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Meta is the wrong site to hold a calm discussion or to wage a battle (take your pick) about comments, downvotes, moderator powers, deletions and ..etc. etc. You're talking to a hardcore user-base who started out as helpful but naive users [and then] later turned hardened and dogmatic. You're right. This site is not the place to have any discussion that is not about support or bugs even though it does have the discussion tag! –@Mari-Lou A</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later I replied (an error)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ha ha my comment about comments being deleted even when the discussion tag exists, got deleted. The rules: extended discussion.must.be.exterminated.because.SE.is.not.a.forum. Exterminate. comments. Migrate.discussions.to.chat.Exterminate.fun.Exterminate.human.interactions. But somehow it's not always consistent, see here?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The “here” linked to an extended discussion on Meta.</p>
<p><strong>Previous suspension</strong></p>
<p>UPDATE Currently suspended on Meta SE for one month (October 13, 2021) because this comment was the final straw....</p>

<p>Comments mostly deleted because it seems I was instigating the closure of a site, luckily I had left the page open so I took a screenshot.</p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER</strong></p>
<p>It may happen on occassion that a strange, black, ironic, sometimes even sarcastic sense of humor overwhelms me. Doctors have diagnosed this as SPAM-MAPS (SPontAneous <a href=""http://www.montypython.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Mp [Multi-Attack Palindrome]</a> Syndrom). It leads to increase in blood pressure, flood of tears, hence visual impairment, inability to eat or drink, intermittent breathing accompanied by weird noises and it is extremly infectious but harmless otherwise.</p>
<p>It is advised to not take things deadly serious then. If you decide to do so nevertheless, please note that you do it at your own risk of suffering from stomachache, a heart attack, a stroke, flatulences[,] killing a butterfly, a fawn, a unicorn or myriads of your neurons.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind:</p>

<p>With that said: Thank you for your cooperation!</p>

<p>SE (Software engineering) Devops:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I implement Agile at team scale through continuous integration/continuous development. I build continuous integration pipelines. I also build Big Data pipelines.</p></li>
<li><p>Working with both SE and Operations, I automate the continuous deployment of continuously developed applications.</p></li>
<li><p>Any SE that I do is from the Devops side of the House i.e. getting the management of the software engineering process right is more important than getting the code architecture right, and getting the code architecture is more important than getting the code well written and well documented.  </p></li>
</ol>

<p>Operations Devops:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>I implement better business continuity and better disaster recovery through continuous deployment.</p></li>
<li><p>I implement Agility through scalability on demand - No more old style capacity planning. If you operate your web site as a service provider and revenue generator, it is mission-critical that you implement Agility in Operations.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The systematic consistency, reliability and up to dateness of ""Infrastructure as code"" and ""immutable infrastructure"" is what I want to have. The code has to to be idempotent, it has to be up to date and it has to work. Period. Any unauthorized change in infrastructure will be eliminated as the code that controls the infrastructure is run. Period. ANY change in infrastructure must be implemented through changes in the code. Period.</p>

<p>I don't want to guess at what somebody wrote in their documentation 6 months ago and hope that it is up to date if I have to restore a full network now - and I an restoring it within hours not  weeks not a month.</p>

<p>Providing Agility in Operations through scalability requires excellence and proficiency in Cloud operations. I view AWS as providing the most complete set of services of any Cloud provider. However, no one does Data Analytics like IBM, no one does SEO and low latency hyper scalability like Google and presumably, no one does Windows Server instances and enterprise-scale Active Directory like Microsoft. The optimal setup will involves mixing and matching of best of breed Cloud services.</p>

<p>Security Devops aka SecDevOps:</p>

<p>Working with SE and Operations, I apply ""infrastructure as code"" and ""immutable infrastructure"" to deploy patches quickly and reliably - I love being able to blue-green within 25 minutes a production network that's been hit by zero-day malware. ""Immutable infrastructure"" is especially valuable to me because I am more worried about users with all the right permissions doing stupid like leaving doors open for random hackers to find. Work with software engineering teams to implement app security through microservices architecture and input validations and to have them architect their apps for cost-effective audit compliance.</p>

<p>And yes, proficiency in orchestration tools is mission critical.</p>

I love problem solving and engineering scalable, flexible solutions that help other people.  I am a strong believer in trying to choose the right programming languages, libraries, or frameworks for the task at hand.</p>

<p>I have developed Web applications in open source and *nix environments since 1996 (including <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Linux</a>, <a href=""http://www.freebsd.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">FreeBSD</a>, and <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IRIX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Silicon Graphics IRIX</a>).  I have an extensive experience with problem solving and solution design, software architectural design, scalability, and network programming.  Since 1998, I have researched and developed natural language processing systems, and since 2002 I researched ontologies, semantic resources, natural language understanding, and information extraction and retrieval while I earned my Ph.D. at in Computer and Information Science at the <a href=""http://www.ntnu.no/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)</a>.  I have developed and given given courses about programming to several organisations.</p>

<p>I started programming 6502 Assembly (for the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Commodore 64</a>) at age 11.  I have a comprehensive programming background in several languages including Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, C, C++, and Prolog, with some experience with Perl and Java.  I'm thoroughly experienced with several database technologies, including PostgreSQL, Berkeley DB, and MySQL.</p>

<p>Specialties: Full-stack development, Problem Analysis, Solution Design, Software Architectural Design, Data Modelling, Natural Language Processing, Computational Linguistics, Knowledge Based Systems, AngularJS, Python, Open Source, GNU/Linux, Web-application Development, System and Network Programming.</p>

<p>I am not a &quot;Sheldon&quot;. <strong>What is a &quot;Sheldon&quot;</strong>? A &quot;Sheldon&quot; is a person who has one or more serious personality aberrations that cause him/her to behave like Sheldon on &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot;. &quot;Big Bang Theory&quot; deliberately ridicules people like Sheldon because these people do exist and are arrogant, domineering, autocratic, brattish, and frequently wrong even though they can't admit it to themselves. <strong>They are intolerant and frequently refuse to consider other perspectives. They often resort to insults</strong>. You wouldn't want a &quot;Sheldon&quot; to have any real power over your life.</p>
<p>I reserve the right to berate anyone behaving in a Sheldon-like fashion. Sheldons may be good at physics and math, etc., but that's all they're good at and <strong>they are frequently disliked by larger segments of the world population</strong>.</p>
<p>I have good social skills and I will not berate anyone that has an &quot;entry level&quot; question. The most important, fundamental questions occur at the entry level.</p>

<p>is innovative textbook introduces a new pattern-based approach to learning proof
methods in the mathematical sciences. Readers will discover techniques that will enable
them to learn new proofs across different areas of pure mathematics with ease. The
patterns in proofs from diverse fields such as algebra, analysis, topology and number
theory are explored. Specific topics examined include game theory, combinatorics, and
Euclidean geometry, enabling a broad familiarity.</p>

<p>The author, an experienced lecturer and researcher renowned for his innovative
view and intuitive style, illuminates a wide range of techniques and examples from
duplicating the cube to triangulating polygons to the infinitude of primes to the
fundamental theorem of algebra. Intended as a companion for undergraduate students,
this text is an essential addition to every aspiring mathematician’s toolkit.</p>

  <p>I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree, And a small cabin build
  there, of clay and wattles made; Nine bean rows will I have there, a
  hive for the honey bee, And live alone in the bee loud glade.</p>
  
  <p>And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,
  Dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings;
  There midnight's all a glimmer, and noon a purple glow, And evening
  full of the linnet's wings.</p>
  
  <p>I will arise and go now, for always night and day I hear lake water
  lapping with low sounds by the shore; While I stand on the roadway, or
  on the pavements grey, I hear it in the deep heart's core..</p>

<p>I'm a planetary scientist and computational physicist. My primary areas of interest are scientific modelling, visualization, magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) and software engineering. I've studied the Sun (somewhat) and Saturn's upper atmosphere (much more) by developing simulations involving magnetohydrodynamics. I currently teach at UWEC.</p>
<p>I'm idealistic and try to be kind.</p>

<hr />
<p><em>&quot;Learn, accept and move on.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;One doesn't need to know the answers, only the process of finding them.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;A more reliable and direct means of arriving at your destination is consistent triangulation between expectations, outcomes and objectives. &quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;An orientation of personality towards an “appraisal” is characterised by a yearning for rewards. It causes stress in case of the failure leading to the formation of a long-lasting fear. An orientation towards a “cause” shows itself in an interest in the subject-matter of the activity. It lessens stress caused by a competition and supports a long-term and successful occupation.&quot;</em></p>
<hr />
<p><em>&quot;People make mistakes in theoretical computation just as they do in numerical computation. It’s best when theory and numerical work validate each other.&quot;</em></p>
<p><em>&quot;The question of whether computers can think is like the
question of whether submarines can swim.&quot;</em><br>
(Edsger W. Dijkstra)</p>
<p><em>&quot;There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is
to make it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies. And
the other way is to make it so complicated that there are no
obvious deficiencies.&quot;</em><br> (C.A.R. Hoare)</p>
<p><em>&quot;When I want to read something nice I sit down and write it.&quot;</em><br>(M. Twain)</p>
<p><em>&quot;All physicists and a good many quite respectable mathematicians are contemptuous about proof.&quot;</em><br>G. Hardy</p>
<p><em>&quot;The object of mathematical rigour is to sanction and legitimize the conquests of intuition, and there was never any other object for it.&quot;</em><br>J. Hadamard</p>
<p><em>&quot;Όταν ρωτήθηκε μερικά χρόνια αργότερα πώς κατάφερε τόσο γρήγορα να φτάσει στην κορυφή, απάντησε: &lt;&lt;Μελετώντας τους δασκάλους, όχι τους μαθητές τους&gt;&gt;.&quot;</em><br>N. H. Abel, Men of Mathematics, E.T. Bell</p>

<p>Feel free to comment on my answers so that I can update/delete the outdated ones.</p>
<p>If you found a good answer from anyone here, you might want to double-check through the official docs before using it in your project. The code might work but could be related to previous trends and you can go into a rabbit hole fixing the new issue too.</p>
<p>It's good we end up thinking</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When I wrote this code, only God and I understood what I did. Now only
God knows.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>otherwise, we can't adapt to the latest trends in technology.</p>

At the moment I've been busily reviewing all sorts of bamboo products, which are amazing.  I got a bamboo mattress and bedding and it improved my breathing <em>so much</em> that I started looking for other things made of bamboo.  It turns out it's good for your health and the environment.  I wish more people would use it.  Bamboo really is an incredible plant.  Of course, you see bamboo pillows advertised on TV, but those are sort of junk, and have so little bamboo that I think in the US they are forced to call it &quot;Rayon from Bamboo&quot; instead of trying to claim it is 100% bamboo.  They also make bamboo sheets from the stuff.  The biggest company is Cariloha, which is a huge chain and has stores everywhere selling bamboo sheets, bamboo underwear, bamboo socks, etc.</p>
<p>There's also a project from columbia university to make bamboo bikes in ghana.  I don't know about that.  I want to get a bamboo bike kit and build my own at some point, but even the kits are like $200 on amazon, so doesn't seem worth it since I can get a non-bamboo bike for much less than that.  Oh well.</p>

I write a lot of bash and emacs lisp, too, and at a previous stage of my career turned out a lot of perl (though I haven't used perl in years).  I've dabbled in TeX and written some LaTeX classes used by others, but am far from an expert.  I prefer the command line to all other interfaces, especially web browsers.  I love git as much as I hate github.  I try to write and use free software whenever possible, and have pretty much succeeded on the writing front but am sometimes forced into using proprietary systems (like the baseband on my phone).</p>

I have instead decided to do the more difficult task of creating my own <strong>useful</strong> operating system.

I am continually trying to learn new things; either by continuing my formal education (currently working towards my Ph.D.), reading or better yet just trying something new.</p>
<p>I enjoy low level programming: kernels, systems programming, robotics, etc. I prefer C or assembly but I can do C++ and if I have to make a GUI application C#. I am familiar with both Linux and Windows userspace and kernel development. I enjoy being challenged, especially when it comes to interacting with hardware. I find only a few things more satisfying than getting that one bit correct which makes the entire thing run because the hardware says that bit has to be that way. Don't get me wrong its maddening up to the point when you fix it, and you start to try to convince yourself that the hardware is broken, and a few rare times it is, but getting it to finally work is extremely satisfying.</p>

<p>I am formally a Cognitive Neuroscience at a Russell Group university in the UK, specialising in motivational processing (hedonics). However I now mostly work with major industrial partners, due to the amount of data available and because of the mounting issues inside academia. I have studied and researched psychology, along with statistics and research methods for over 10 years which culminated in  PhD in Psychology and Neuroscience with a focus on motivational processing. I have extensive experience in mentoring, teaching, counselling and working with both neurological damage, mental health issues, and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>I'm passionate about logic and reason, as a consequence I believe that improving the language and evidence we use in psychology is fundamental helping individuals understand psychology. Options and suppositions all too often prevail in popular culture when discussing psychological functions or mental health. In the contemporary environments there are huge amounts of research detailing how the brain processes information and how this influences our thinking and behaviour. We need to continue to move away from opinions and feelings, and toward evidence and facts.</p>

It is not that we have anything against Feynman or this lecture — quite the opposite. Rather, our unwritten rule is intended to encourage variety in the introductions of articles, which is why we also discourage references to Moore's law in opening sentences. However, we are making an exception for this issue because it contains a number of articles1 that mark the 50th anniversary of Feynman's lecture, which he delivered to a meeting of the American Physical Society at the California Institute of Technology on 29 December 1959</p>

<p>&quot;Like a trooper, the carpenter sharpens his own tools. He carries his
equipment in his tool box, and works under the direction of his foreman.
He makes columns and girders with an axe, shapes floorboards and
shelves with a plane, cuts fine openwork and carvings accurately, giving
as excellent a finish as his skill will allow. This is the craft of the carpenters. When the carpenter becomes skilled and understands measures
he can become a foreman.&quot;</p>

<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, and welcome to this random assortment of facts.</p>

<p>I have been developing software for a long time. I also manage software projects. I enjoy both the tactical aspect of writing code as well as the strategic aspect of keeping the customer happy, the development team happy and building software that will Do Something Useful.</p>

<h2>Industries I've Worked</h2>

<p>IT is everywhere! Most industries are very similar when it comes to employee needs, although one might think they're very different. I've seen Financial Traders get just as worked up and panicked as Healthcare Staff when their systems aren't working properly. My job is to make it so whatever the user wants to do is <em>EASY</em> and, in effect, so that they don't even notice me.*</p>

<ul>
<li>Business Process Improvement,</li>
<li>Chemical,</li>
<li>Education,</li>
<li>Energy (oil, gas, &amp; electricity),</li>
<li>Entertainment,</li>
<li>Financial,</li>
<li>Healthcare,</li>
<li>Marketing,</li>
<li>Media,</li>
<li>Property Management, and</li>
<li>Software (the company's actual product)

<ul>
<li>Web Development</li>
<li>Mobile (Android + IOS) App Development</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite OS</h2>

<ul>
<li>Mac OSX is my primary (the command line rocks for unleashing the power of bash)</li>
<li>Debian for regular server</li>
<li><strike>Windows</strike> <strike>XBox</strike> PS4 for the games</li>
</ul>

<h2>Preferred Browsers</h2>

<ul>
<li>Chrome, hands down</li>
<li>Firefox, if you're nasty</li>
<li>Safari, if I must</li>
<li>IE if you want me to hate my job</li>
</ul>

<h2>Favorite Languages</h2>

<p>There isn't really a favorite, just languages that are better suited for a particular task/application. I want to <strong>use the best tool for the job</strong>, because <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument"" rel=""nofollow"">not everything is a nail</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Ruby/Rails</li>
<li>Perl</li>
<li>Objective C</li>
<li>Javascript</li>
<li>NodeJS (Angular, Ember, etc)</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>PHP</li>

I was born in Ithaca, NY, and studied biomedical engineering and engineering physics there at Cornell, before getting my M.Sc. Applied Physics from the TU Delft in the Netherlands. I call both countries home but right now I am living in Kansas City. I am here because I love people and I want them to excel.</p>

<p>If you are reading this because I used some level of abstraction in some answer that went way over your head, I am sorry: it is because that is to me the simplest form of that idea.  <strong>Please feel free</strong> to ask me in comments to ""dumb down"" these sorts of details; and I will do my best. There are usually easier ways to explain special cases and stuff.</p>

<p>So, for example, the work-energy theorem <em>can</em> be worked out, in a limited sense, with <em>plain middle-school algebra</em>: but if you know vectors and calculus, the ""differential"" form (P = dK/dt) is much easier and clearer to start with, and the work-energy theorem is just the time-integral of that. So I will tend towards the ""easy/clear"" version with vectors and calculus: but if you don't know vectors and calculus, you're going to miss out! If you are reading this because that has happened, <strong>ask me in comments</strong> for the lower-skill-level explanation, and I will try to give you that middle-school algebra version.</p>

<p>(But, for your own good, learn vectors and calculus. It is a tragedy that people try to teach physics without some ""0th-year-course"" on those topics. In fact college courses seem to reteach the same stuff year after year at all skill levels, just because they don't want to set aside a prerequisite freshman course on the subject to teach it to everyone together.)</p>

<h3>Userscripts</h3>
<p>I've made some userscripts for the Stack Exchange sites you may be interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>My SOOF userscript, now <a href=""http://stackapps.com/questions/6091"">Stack Overflow Extras</a>, has a bunch of optional features you can add to 'enhance' SE (examples of these features are: pre-defined edit reasons; side-by-side post editing; highlight answerer's names in comments, and so on)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6571/26088"">SE WYSIWYG Editor</a> userscript adds a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) Editor to Stack Exchange - definitely worth a try! :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6353/26088"">Freehand Circles Drawing Tool</a> userscript allows you to draw directly onto images you see on SE sites - you can change the brush colour and width to draw <em>anything</em> you might want - it's great fun, useful and easy to use :)</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6316/26088"">Self Destructing Comments</a> userscript allows you to set a date at which a comment you wrote should be deleted - useful for those 'comment cleanup', 'thanks', or 'welcome' comments.</li>
<li>My <a href=""http://stackapps.com/q/6460/26088"">SE Desktop Notifications</a> userscript shows desktop notifications whenever there is new activity on a question open in a new tab - useful for keeping track of questions without having to scroll through the answers to see if there is a new edit, or comment, or score change :)</li>
<li>See <em>many</em> more at my <a href=""http://stackapps.com/users/26088/"">Stack Apps profile</a> :)</li>

<p>My main fields of interest are Real/Complex Analysis and Probability:  more specifically, I am currently learning the basics of (stochastic) homogenization theory and (stochastic) optimal control theory.
I like almost anything I have ever encountered in analysis and probability. Functional analysis is particularly elegant to me, along with differential geometry and (the little I know of) algebraic topology.</p>

<p>I like Go, as a statically typed C-style-OOP systems programming language, but it doesn't have generics, and doesn't encourage functional practices. D encourages functional programming, proper OOP and fixes the problems of C and Go while being a better C++, and more productive / less dumb than Java.</p>

<p>While I love Python, it feels too mundane; for everyday tasks I prefer <a href=""http://racket-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Racket</a> and <a href=""http://factor-lang.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Factor</a>.</p>

<p>The aim of my thesis is to design an effective resolution tool to test the consistency of logical formulas in modal logic problem that we call Modal-SAT. 
One approach is to study the various ways to reduce the problem to a SAT problem for which there are effective solvers in practice: for example SAT, SMT or ASP. 
Another approach is to design a solver ""ad hoc"" for Modal-SAT adapting the principles and techniques of the best solvers mentioned above. </p>

<p>The evaluation of solvers requires a diverse set of benchmarks, ideally representing actual Modal-SAT problems (as opposed to randomly generated problems or academic examples). 
An important aspect of my thesis will be to collect and classify Modal SAT problems available in the community and create new ones. </p>

<p>In particular, the thesis will focus on games with epistemic modeling aspects, ie games (cooperative or not) where the participants must reason on the knowledge that the other participants have of the game. The result of the thesis should ideally be the realization of a software player capable of participating in this type of game, using the Modal-SAT solver as the only reasoning engine.</p>

<p><strong>Hi! I'm Jeff.</strong> I am currently a tech lead on Google Maps Platform (Android, iOS, and Javascript SDKs) in Mountain View, CA, though my opinions and advice are my own. In my personal time, I enjoy lindy hop swing dancing, photography, aviation (as a private pilot), and organizing furry conventions.</p>
<p>Though I like helping with any answers I can, I am found most often on StackOverflow. I particularly like helping debug and explain <strong>Guice</strong>, <strong>Dagger</strong>, and <strong>Mockito</strong>, which I count as some of the most-powerful (and sometimes least-intuitive) packages available in Java today.</p>
<p>My five favorite computer science inventions: Code-generating serialization layers (Protocol Buffers and Thrift), Bloom filters, Hilbert indexes, A* search, and CompactHashSet. I'm also a fan of DI and mocking frameworks, as you can see above. :)</p>

I get it. They have people T.A that are in academic probation and probably got kick out the program by now. They also have Germans T.Aing and gettiing the best research. They are so superior in every way. I get it. I am so  dumb.  I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. </p>

<p>SDSU DOES NOT PRODUCE ANY RESEARCH IN MATHEMATICS.I have sumbitted applications to PHD programs. Faculty for the most part have not written anything. </p>

<p>I have to work. I manage to find a line cook position. It's like Hell's Kitchen. It is stressfull. The Last thing I want to do is to go back. Hopefully, PHD program says yes. AGAIN, SDSU DOES NOT PRODUCE MATHEMATICAL RESEARCH AND THEY LACK CLASSES, RESOURCES. </p>

<p>The real problem behind the &quot;not for extensive discussions&quot; thing is probably that some answers on some subsites tries to appear formal and complete, while in fact, nobody knows an ideal answer. It could be still understandable on Workspace, but obviously horrible on Parenting. Answers on some other websites that nobody ever wanted a discussion usually tries to appear informal to acknowledge that &quot;this might not be the perfect answer, but hope it has helped you a bit&quot;. On the other hand, they are more permissive to personal opinions and duplicates, instead, as a result. Alternatively, they simply don't have a commenting feature, but visible downvotes, to acknowledge that this answer is not verified by many.</p>

<p>My primary work is computational modelling of decision-making behaviour. That is I take a series of decisions from a group of participants and assess the ways these people process and combine information available to them when making choices.</p>
<h2>What I love</h2>
<p>Most of my modelling work is done in <strong>R</strong>. The experimental tasks I develop are done in both <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Javascript</strong>, and non-modelling analysis I tend to switch between <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> depending on the availability of useful libraries.</p>
<h2>Other experience</h2>
<p>I have also touched on <strong>MATLAB</strong>, <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>C#</strong> and many other languages during my time. I have taught many courses both in-person and more recently online in introductory to intermediate <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>R</strong> (focussing on data analysis toolchains), the use of high-performance computing infrastructure, <strong>SQL</strong> and more.</p>

<h1>Why we're here</h1>

<p>The vision of Stack Exchange is important, and worth fighting for; our fight is not against each other, but against stagnation and fatigue. Do not become weary of doing well; and do not become content with your personal best!</p>

<p>If you're new, reach deep, learn (and then teach), and do more. If you're senior, train up others to complement or succeed you. Above all, let us celebrate our success! We're a community of competent, driven scholars: we have the best questions <em>and</em> the best answers!</p>

<h1>Why I'm here</h1>

<p>I like to think I am sharing in the experience of others here on Stack Exchange. I search for the perspective of others; and I take away value each time I visit; in turn, I hope to shape the experience of others in a positive way: by giving useful feedback, cajoling newcomers into constructive creators, and reminding senior members to continue giving the best of their experience&nbsp;&mdash; and the benefit of doubt.</p>

<h1>Who I am</h1>

<p>I recently discovered photography, and used a couple mirrors to take a selfie of taking a selfie. (Thus, my avatar.) As you can see, I'm always looking for a new creative outlet, and I enjoy puns entirely too much! My variety of hobbies (ranging from needlepoint to theatre) makes me relatable to a wide variety of persons: if I haven't tried it already, then I plan to at some point, and you're the perfect person to introduce me to it!</p>

new things. My major interests recently are programming models and methods
for concurrency/async, esp. <em>testing</em> things involving concurrency/async, applications
of functional programming, and doing interesting things with Mathematica.</p>
<p>Also, I have an unreasonable affection for certain computer languages.  Including
Spitbol, C++, Self, Scheme, awk, FORTH, Erlang, J, Smalltalk, Logo, BLISS, Haskell, and Algol 68.</p>
<p>(And there are a couple of PLs I hate with the heat of 1000 O-type stars: XSLT, TeX (considered as a language).  I'm not fond of Perl, either. But maybe just with the heat of a few dozen O-type stars.) As far as Solidity goes: jury is still out.  But it's not looking good.)</p>
<p>I'm working at <a href=""https://swirldslabs.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Swirlds Labs</a>, building the high TPS, low latency to consensus DLT <a href=""https://hedera.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hedera</a>, based on the groundbreaking <a href=""https://hedera.com/hh-ieee_coins_paper-200516.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Hashgraph ABFT algorithm/data structure</a>. I'm especially excited about the many commercial, industrial, NGO use cases that are <em>not financial</em> that are especially suited to this DLT.  This project is beneficial to society. The technical challenges here extremely interesting.  (And the people are great to work with.)</p>
<p>FYI, when it comes to coding standards I only have two firm rules:</p>
<ol>
<li>No hard tabs (<code>'\t' == '\x09'</code>) in files.</li>
<li>Files end with a newline.</li>
</ol>
<p>Other than those two rules, I'll go with whatever the team wants.  (Life's too short to worry about it.)</p>

<p>And most importantly, a very passionate Christian. I wasn't the typical Christian. I didn't grow up in a religious family. I was an ardent atheist.  But God was willing to show even a wretch like me at age 17. Sometimes the simplest answer, even as preposterous as it seems, will be the truth. Logic is beautiful. Many key on it for determining motivation behind actions. But the bigger question is why at all? And where once I didn't believe there was anything bigger to life, now I am certain there is. We just often don't want to see it, because we're too prideful of our own skills and minds, and too worried about what we'll lose.<br />
Jesus Christ is Lord.<br />
Seek ardently and you can and will find Him.</p>
<p>Many of my passions stem from that, whether it's answering questions in places like this, providing weather information (feel free to message me anytime for meteorological input), teaching, or just trying to make a difference.<br />
To God alone belongs every glory!</p>

<p>Here is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:</p>
<h3>SI units</h3>
<p>To avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SI brochure</a>, but there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit, for example: 12 V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-breaking space</a>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol, <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 V (normal space)</li>
<li>12 V (&amp;nbsp;)</li>
<li>12 V (&amp;#8239;)</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>&quot;I'm in Europe.&quot;</em></h3>
<p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em>, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>
<p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this legal?</li>
<li>Where can I buy things?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Latin Language</strong>: Not as good as my Japanese but still learning.</p>
<p><strong>Stack Exchange</strong>: Python is my main programming language. I also have an interest in web app development and cryptography.</p>

<p>Hobby: I like to fly in private aircraft (passenger or supernumerary crew) and I do it several times a year sometimes by arrangement and sometimes by ""hitchhiking"" at private fields. By arrangement I do stuff like baby sitting, pet delivery, chaperoning, translating, mock landing interviews, and gift delivery. The furthest east I have been is London -> Samarkand (single engine Cherokee). The furthest west I have been is London -> Los Angeles (many different aircraft, including a G650). The most stressful are the landings at Nuuk to refuel.  The easiest airport to ""hitch"" a ride is in Texas USA.</p>

<ul>
<li>Oracle TimesTen is a monster. Holy crap though, it is blazingly fast.</li>
<li>Guice is a beast which should only be used when you never want people to know where data is coming from. It could be justified by testing, but for the love of all that is holy QUIT MAKING SO MANY MODULES. You need like, 3, for a medium-sized project.</li>
<li>Mockito is amazing &lt;3</li>
<li>MySQL performs like a drunken elephant, but it's free and easy to use. Also, it's workbench is very nice, and I like it.</li>
<li>It is frustrating that most Linux developers act like Linux is the default environment for computers. If Linux is so superior, then why can't it (or at least most of the main utilities for Linux) handle even the most basic crap like a CRLF? Why don't people make many good video games for it? Is it more secure, or do Linux users just tend to actually follow basic security protocols?</li>

I'm inspired by John von Neumann, Richard Feynman, Nikola Tesla, Elon Musk, and Steve Jobs.</p>

<p><em>If you need a few quotes by The Great Explainer, see below.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>I hate rigorous proofs, but I know they're good for me. Here's why:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>The first principle is that you must not fool yourself and you are the easiest person to fool.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>Examples don't only improve understanding, they help validate it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I'm an ignorant teen. Not to worry, for I'm a curious teen as well!</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It is in the admission of ignorance and the admission of uncertainty that there is a hope for the continuous motion of human beings in some direction that doesn't get confined, permanently blocked, as it has so many times before in various periods in the history of man.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>If your still on first principles like I am, don't feel too bad.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>If you keep proving stuff that others have done, getting confidence, increasing the complexities of your solutions - for the fun of it - then one day you'll turn around and discover that nobody actually did that one!</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>You haven't lived if you can't relate to this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>If I get stuck, I look at a book that tells me how someone else did it. I turn the pages, and then I say, 'Oh, I forgot that bit,' then close the book and carry on. Finally, after you've figured out how to do it, you read how they did it and find out how dumb your solution is and how much more clever and efficient theirs is!</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>
</blockquote>

<hr>

<p>I study like this, too:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h2>It's the way I study - to understand something by trying to work it out or, in other words, to understand something by creating it. Not creating it one hundred percent, of course; but taking a hint as to which direction to go but not remembering the details. These you work out for yourself.</h2>
  
  <p>Richard P. Feynman</p>

I have a BA in Geography from California State University Fullerton  in 1996 and I also earned my GIS certificate from the University of California Riverside GIS Extension Program in 1999. </p>

<p>I love discussions of all sorts, and I actively participate in them whenever I feel like it (wether it's on meta or in chat).</p>

<p><strong>What I enjoy:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>discussions</li>
<li>analysing anything</li>
<li>programming</li>
<li>designing projects</li>

<p><strong>What I absolutely dislike:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>working with a poorly designed project</li>
<li>ignorance</li>
<li>""Separators"" (properties used to separate people into different categories)

<ul>
<li>Popular examples are ethnicity, skin color, gender</li>
</ul></li>
<li>""offended"" people

<ul>
<li>If someone disagrees with your opinion, <em>deal with it</em></li>
<li>If someone does something you dislike, <em>deal with it</em></li>
</ul></li>

<p>Please understand that whatever one does, it's that persons business, as long as it is not actually affecting other people, and even then it's just bound by laws. If I were to tell a person off for believing in the spaghetti monster because it offends me, how'd that make me look like?

<p>I have 18 years of programming under my belt - with 13 years actually working as a Software Developer for various different companies, with 8 of those as a team leader - focusing mostly on the Microsoft Stack, in special C# and SQL Server.</p>
<p>Currently I'm the tech and team lead for a small but really awesome team of devs. We work on several projects that deal with a wide selection of domains - Human Resources, Finances, Logistics, Colorimetry, Research, Analytics, and many other cool stuff.</p>
<p>Programming is somewhat of a family business to me. Every one of the kids of my Great-Gramps ended up in IT sooner or later, with several of their sons and daughters also joining the IT fray in one form or another. My grandfather was the one that inspired me to join software development and taught me how to develop systems for DBASE III when I was really little, and since them I've been doing software both as a hobby and as a job.</p>
<p>I went trough college for Computer Science and started working on the field as an intern on the same semester I hit college, doing a lot of advanced math work that honestly shouldn't have been given to an intern. I learned that college wouldn't really prepare me better than real-life experiences on the my field, so I started learning every single thing I could for everyone I worked with - my peers, my bosses, colleagues from different departments... I found out that I love to learn stuff, and I strive to learn at least one new thing every day.</p>
<p>I also have around 13 years of Dungeon Mastering experience - mostly with d20 systems, especially D&amp;D 3.X and Pathfinder.</p>
<p>Currently, I'm running a Shadowrun game every other week using mostly Discord to conduct my games.</p>

<hr />
<p>Prior to studying for a Masters degree in EE, I was a hobbyist in electronics and had been for many years - I started programming with Lego Mindstorms when I was little and slowly worked my way into building electronic kits and then on to designing circuits. I taught myself PCB design and much of the practical aspects of circuit design when digitising a model railway that I have on my windowsill (block detection, control of points, signals, etc.).</p>
<p>It wasn't until going to university that in being taught the fundamentals of circuit design and theory that I started having much more success with my hobby and am now turning that into a career in electronics. Having learnt to program in C/C++ during my first year at Uni, I moved on and taught myself to program in Verilog and work with FPGAs - digital logic circuitry being my main area of interest.</p>
<p>For my Masters year I developed an FPGA based data transfer system based around a low level PCIe IP core (Altera) and in the process taught myself how to write Windows KMDF drivers and DLLs. In fact this project landed me a job at Georgia Tech where I continued development of the system and have since turned it into a Ultrasound Imaging Platform which is configurable enough to be useful in many other research areas including medical research and industrial applications.</p>

61709,301,2016-09-12T14:35:51.000,Bruno Le Floch,2022-10-18T17:04:14.350,http://users.aims.ac.za/~bruno/,France,"<p>I've been using LaTeX more and more in the past nine years, initially typesetting solutions to maths problems, later taking notes in class for more than a year. </p>

<p>A few months back I had some ideas about writing a package. I was (un?)fortunate enough to find a copy of the TeXbook in my school's library.  Since then, I have been hooked by the strange style of programming that TeX macros provide.</p>

<p>This has led me to become a member of the LaTeX3 team in May 2011.  This was an exciting time to join the project: the team improved consistency of the <code>expl3</code> language provided by <code>l3kernel</code> considerably, and we have seen people starting to code in the language.  I have focussed in making the <code>l3kernel</code> code as fast and bullet-proof as possible (two often conflicting aims).  </p>

<p>Current LaTeX projects: </p>

<ul>
<li><p>Get <code>l3fp</code> to reach full <code>IEEE-754 (2008)</code> compliance.  This module, which I am quite proud of, lets us parse expandably floating point expressions, in a way similar to eTeX's <code>\the\numexpr...\relax</code> for integers.  The main missing parts are signalling <code>NaN</code>s and subnormal numbers, as well as providing functions to control the rounding mode.</p></li>
<li><p>Enrich <code>l3fp</code> with more functions, such as <code>atan</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Clean up <code>l3regex</code>, the LaTeX3 regular expression engine, marking it as stable.  In particular, add functions to act on a file, sed-like.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a PEG parser operating on strings.  This could in principle be done expandably, but I am not yet sure whether it is necessarily useful.</p></li>
<li><p>Write a C compiler (this is not for LaTeX3, mostly to learn how compilers work).  Having a full C-to-TeX compiler would immediately provide access to many other languages from TeX, since many compilers are written in C.  Of course, the code would run rather slowly, and much slower than using LuaTeX.</p></li>
<li><p>Enable TeX to produce text output instead of pdf.  This could be done either by using LuaTeX, or by modifying an engine, or by emulating TeX within TeX (which I have partly done).</p></li>
<li><p>Help with debugging macros either by providing a graphical interface to visualize expansion, or (easier, and partly done) by performing steps of expansion or assignments one by one and showing partial results with <code>\typeout</code> within TeX.</p></li>
<li><p>Understand how to best generalize LaTeX3's <code>\tl_expandable_lowercase:n</code> to do more general token-list transformations expandably.  This might combine with the idea of a parser.</p></li>
<li><p>Perform partial macro expansion in a file, which would distinguish between user-defined macros and macros defined in a package.</p></li>
<li><p>Write an os-independent Makefile-like Lua program.</p></li>
<li><p>A few dormant packages, including the one that brought me to the TeX path two years ago.</p></li>

What you're referring to as calculus, is in fact, real analysis, or as I've recently taken to calling it, $\left( \mathbf R,\, +,\, \times,\, \leqslant,\, \left| \cdot \right|,\, \tau \,=\, \left{ A \,\subset\, \mathbf R \mid \forall x\,\in\, A,\, \exists \varepsilon \,>\, 0,\, \left] x \,-\, \varepsilon,\, x \,+\, \varepsilon\right[ \,\subset\, A \right},\, \bigcap_{\begin{array}{c} A \,\sigma \text{-algebra of}\, \mathbf R \ \tau \,\subset\, A \end{array}} A,\, \ell \right)$-analysis. Calculus is not a branch of mathematics unto itself, but rather another application of a fully functioning analysis made useful by topology, measure theory and vital $\mathbf R$-related properties comprising a full number field as defined by pure mathematics.</p>

<p>Many mathematics students and professors use applications of real analysis every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the application of real analysis which is widely used today is often called ""Calculus"", and many of its users are not aware that it is merely a part of real analysis, developed by the Nicolas Bourbaki group.</p>

<p>There really is a calculus, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the field they use. Calculus is the computation process: the set of rules and formulae that allow the mathematical mind to derive numerical formulae from other numerical formulae. The computation process is an essential part of a branch of mathematics, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete number field. Calculus is normally used in combination with the real number field, its topology and its measured space: the whole system is basically real numbers with analytical methods and properties added, or real analysis. All the so-called calculus problems are really problems of real analysis.</p>

<p>My dissertation focuses on both collecting and adding to the small body of literature on the difficulty (NP Hardness) of the problem of Compressive Sensing in general from the standard combinatorial optimization approach, improving the background for these results in detail and extending them to the general problem over vector spaces of finite fields, as well as adding new proofs applicable to these general approaches, and of developing and analyzing computational programs generic enough to deal with Compressive Sensing over finite fields.  </p>

<p>I am also an Assistant Professor at Mercy College of Health Sciences and a former community college math professor, and have taught courses ranging from experimental computer-based developmental mathematics through Differential Equations, Linear Algebra, Engineering Problems and Programming, and junior-level Biostatistics. I have been at my current position in Des Moines, Iowa, since Fall of 2016. </p>

<p>I additionally research Real, Complex, and Functional Analysis; ancient, modern, and differential Geometry; the math of medical imagery; statistics and its use in biomedical research; Linear and Abstract Algebra; synoptic meteorology; and, lastly, the history and education of mathematics and statistics. I live with my wife and two parrots and, when not doing mathematics, enjoy chasing tornadoes in the Central Plains of the United States.</p>

Our aim was to better understand how new types of antibiotics kill bacteria, to support rational design of improved new compounds. This was pretty cool stuff but I enjoyed the data-analysis most of all, so I became a data scientist.</p>

<p>Some years ago I learned Java but only a few bits are left of it. Even though I commonly use xUbuntu as operating system I try to keep track with the newer Windows version and the MS Office package.</p>
<p>In my free time I like gardening and doing sports :-) .</p>

I teach 4-5 courses per year, and have taught courses in math, computer science, and statistics. I got my PhD in 2014 from Wesleyan University (in Connecticut) and was an undergrad at Bowdoin College (in Maine).</p>
<p>Details about my research: In math, I'm mostly interested in questions involving (semi) model categories, Bousfield localization, and algebras over (colored) operads. I like to apply my work to unstable, stable, equivariant, and motivic homotopy theory, to homological algebra, and to representation theory. In computer science, I think about graph theory, randomized algorithms, streaming computation, genetic algorithms, data science, and data systems. In applied statistics, I've done research (often with students) related to the opioid epidemic, policing and protests, gun violence, and a host of other topics. I've also begun to dabble in economics, biostatistics, and pedagogical research, thanks to my co-authors. In my spare time, I travel as much as possible. As of 2023, I've visited 143 countries and published 33 papers and a book.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>Decently good C++ dev who enjoys clean public interface design, obscure language lawyer rules, and making decisions based on solid design tenets. I answer questions on here because it helps me learn and scratches that teaching itch.</p>
<p>My uncommon life journey has helped me appreciate that people come from many backgrounds, regions, countries, and beliefs. I don't tolerate intolerance, nor should you. If you think that somebody's right to exist is up for debate, then the fact that you're an idiot is not up for debate.</p>
<p>I like social justice, being in awe at how eerie it is to enter a park in the middle of a major city and feel transported a hundred miles away, and sweet food.</p>
<hr />
<h2>Learning C++? Read this</h2>
<p>Q: <em>I have this problem involving arrays and dynamic memory allocation, how do I...</em></p>
<p>A: Use <code>std::vector</code></p>
<p>Q: <em>I can't, I'm not allowed to. This is for class.</em></p>
<p>A: Your class is setting you up for failure. They should be teaching you how to use <code>std::vector</code> and <code>std::string</code>. If you're not allowed to use <code>std::vector</code>, <a href=""https://github.com/jfilleau/dumbvector"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">write your own</a> <code>my::vector</code>. It doesn't need to be complicated.</p>
<p>Q: <em>Why does my program crash when I pass my <code>MyClass</code> object by value / copy construct it / assign it</em></p>
<p>A: Because you're not using <code>std::vector</code> and you're not following <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/2321511/2027196"">RAII</a> (yes it's a horrible name and doesn't even form a clever initialization).</p>
<p>Q: <em>I don't want to use <code>std::vector</code> because it's too easy / I want to learn how to do my own memory management.</em></p>
<p>A: If you don't want to use <code>std::vector</code> then <a href=""https://github.com/jfilleau/dumbvector"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">write your own</a> <code>my::vector</code>.</p>

<p><strong>When I'm among engineers</strong> and statisticians I struggle following them while talking on R code, matrices or logarithms (they love them...). <strong>When I'm among my fellow physicians</strong> they think I'm a statistics and methods expert and a graphs magician (this not true!)</p>

<p>Appart from Medicine, that I love, I supose my expertise area in science is <strong>this grey area between the clinician and the ""highly scientific"" worlds</strong>. They usually don't understand themselves... </p>

<p>It's hard for a clinician to explain a statistician what medical practice really does and measures (not an easy field of knowledge as well!), and <strong>it's sad noticing how such high level clinicians some times end up performing such low level research</strong>. 
Clinical researchers, usually without protected time to conduct their research, sometimes don't have access to methodologists or they sank in science related arenas hostile for newcomers -permission asking, bibliography handling, journals or universities traditions...-</p>

<p>It is also easy for the methodolgist to get hypnotized by ""highly reputed"" science and end up leading sophisticated research that discover sophisticated banalities (sometimes things my grandmother already knew, although she barely could write)</p>

<p>I cannot write complex code, but I can notice when clinical research is sound or not, and I think I can make things quite clear to clinical researchers.</p>

I have a degree in molecular biology and specialized in virology after that didn't worked out so well. Now I am not working in anything related to science. I simply didn't have the chance to pursue my dreams because people thought they were too far away to be of any <strong>use</strong> in science and funding was limited. But this didn't despaired me, it <strong>MOTIVATED</strong> me to go any further and further into subjects NO one would <strong>dare!</strong></p>
<p>And it is pretty much how things are still to this day. Although I don't have a fancy lab or a warm desk to return to in some cozy university I <strong>push forward</strong> every day analyzing the potential of ideas no one else would dare explore. I know I risk a lot but can't imagine doing anything else. This is why my research and ideas can seem quite UNorthodox to my colleagues and they may disagree with me. But it doesn't bothers me-when you are outside the system you sometimes can see things those on the inside are blind to! And I am one of those people who like to remind the others this.</p>
<p>Since I have no funding and no job in any university my research is mostly theoretical and often oriented towards philosophy and finding &quot;holes&quot; in the research of others, rather than to do anything myself. But it doesn't mean I have no ideas of my own or I am some sort of evil force searching for the mistakes of others to smear them. What my time and energy are contributed to are only the <strong>most important question</strong> in biology-the nature, origin, organization and evolution of life itself! This is my life's quest-to find <strong>a single theory</strong> to explain <strong>ALL</strong> life and be able to answer to <strong>ALL</strong> those tricky questions biologists often got, but can't mumble a single word about them! I can! :)</p>
<p>While most scientists complain about not having enough ideas and been too pressured to come up with new ideas, my problem is quite the opposite-I have so many ideas I <strong>can't</strong> pursue them <strong>all</strong>! I simply feel like my mind, spirit and body can't cope with everything I am seeing and want to explore. I feel like I need to cover so vast expenses of knowledge to proceed I just can't keep up with my research any more. The last few years I have been reading and reading all the time I could get and thinking and exploring as much as I can but it just is <strong>not possible</strong> for me any more to see how far my ideas can get. I think this year I've finally reached my limit! If I want to proceed from now on I simply <strong>need help!</strong> I need to ask a lot of questions to people from many (sometimes seemingly unrelated fields of science) so I can get the information I need to proceed. My brain is at its full capacity but even that isn't enough any more to continue exploring my ideas. The information I need is simply too much to search it out on my own. I now want to give my research to all the colleagues who can use it and together to see how far can it go and what precisely I have stumbled upon!</p>

<p>My main participation is on MathOverflow. I try to engage with any question that I find interesting. I strive for self-contained answers with clear explanations. I post answers to questions that I know how to answer or which I am able to figure out. I try to express my mathematical ideas in plain language when possible. I am less concerned with whether a question or answer conforms with various rules, as long as it leads to interesting mathematical ideas. In my view, answers on MathOverflow are mainly for the benefit of the broader community, rather than for the particular person who asked the question.</p>
<p>Contemplating a mathematical puzzle on MathOverflow has been one of the routine enjoyments in my life. Read my remarks on <a href=""http://jdh.hamkins.org/mathoverflow-the-eternal-fountain-of-mathematics-reflections-on-a-hundred-kiloreps/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MathOverflow: the eternal fountain of mathematics</a>.</p>
<p>I strongly prefer answers that explain a mathematical idea to answers that provide a reference for where that idea might be explained elsewhere. Similarly, I find questions that ask for a mathematical explanation to be more interesting than questions that ask for a reference.</p>

<p>I probably did <strong>not</strong> downvote you, so don't assume that just because I'm the only one responding to your question that it was me. The vast majority of the time I will try to probe you to make your question, answer or comment better.</p>
<p>I follow the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/php"">PHP tag</a> pretty regularly. I'll also help with WordPress-related posts, unless the question is about a specific plugin or theme, or about Gutenberg, in which case it should probably be posted over on <a href=""https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/"">WordPress Dev</a>.</p>
<p>I tend to comment way more than answer because I hold the quality of my answers very high. If something can be solved with a two or three sentence comment, I'm probably not going to post that as an answer. With that knowledge, if I post a comment that is helpful and I don't answer, I hereby grant everyone, including the OP themselves, permission to write an answer based on that. Courtesy says you should acknowledge the comment, but I won't lose any sleep if you don't.</p>
<p><em>(My commenting policy really bugged this one person once, and they actually told me that I shouldn't post <em>anything</em> in that case. Something like &quot;If you can't be bothered to write a quality answer, you should leave this to other people that will&quot;. Hmm, no, I will always try to help someone if I think I can.)</em></p>
<p>I also like talking and writing about technical things, and given the stage, I can go <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/website-metrics-everything-you-need-know-about-bounce-rate-google-analytics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/4-steps-building-website"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a> and <a href=""https://vendiadvertising.com/insight/content-management-system"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">on</a>.</p>

I like to solve olympiad-level math problems when I'm in the mood for it and I also dabble in coding from time to time. Writing is something I have a knack for. I can write well enough in English, despite being a non-native English speaker. </p>

Compiler of languages.  Now professionally a problem solver -- 18 years with a fab-less semiconductor company making systems-on-chip with lots of tasty imaging interfaces, image processing hardware, industry standard real-world connections, all covered by high-protein firmware.  One year with a consulting company doing various med-tech and other commercial products.  CTO of a medical device company.</p>
<p>I have a continued interest in mechatronic systems, machining, welding, CAM, and kids.  My wife says it is all a busman's holiday.</p>
<p>I have mentored a FIRST robotics team (#2349).  It was great fun to coach high school students on engineering problems, project planning, prototyping, and especially teamwork.  I sing Barbershop with some truly congenial and talented men as a member of Vocal Revolution.  I enjoy an occasional Amateur Radio on-air conversation or contest as K1UZK.</p>
<p>I also do custom woodworking, carvings, and 3D printed spiritualia as Carvings by Carl, which can be found on Etsy.</p>

<p>iOS developer and team lead with over 5 years' experience developing and shipping mobile applications in the banking sector.</p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>Born and raised in Australia, I received a Bachelor of Electronic and Computer Engineering from Griffith University, Brisbane, Australia. After graduating, I immigrated to Paraguay where I took a developer job in software. </p>

<p><strong>Experience</strong></p>

<p>I have over 5 years at my current employer where I begun as a developer and moved to a team lead after the first year. During the ensuring years I have maintained a very hands-on development role where I implemented significant portions of dozens of apps, and coded a couple of complete apps from start to finish.</p>

<p>From a project management perspective, I am responsible for complete projects including project definition, requirements analysis, architecture, development, quality assurance, deployments, and publication of apps to the App Store and Play Store. I also maintain legacy projects written in Objective-C (some that I myself developed) for iOS.</p>

  <p>I have a friend who's an artist and has sometimes taken a view which I don't agree with very well. He'll hold up a flower and say ""look how beautiful it is,"" and I'll agree. Then he says ""I as an artist can see how beautiful this is but you as a scientist take this all apart and it becomes a dull thing,"" and I think that he's kind of nutty. First of all, the beauty that he sees is available to other people and to me too, I believe. Although I may not be quite as refined aesthetically as he is ... I can appreciate the beauty of a flower. At the same time, I see much more about the flower than he sees. I could imagine the cells in there, the complicated actions inside, which also have a beauty. I mean it's not just beauty at this dimension, at one centimeter; there's also beauty at smaller dimensions, the inner structure, also the processes. The fact that the colors in the flower evolved in order to attract insects to pollinate it is interesting; it means that insects can see the color. It adds a question: does this aesthetic sense also exist in the lower forms? Why is it aesthetic? All kinds of interesting questions which the science knowledge only adds to the excitement, the mystery and the awe of a flower. It only adds. I don't understand how it subtracts.</p>

My first computer was a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaypro"" rel=""nofollow"">KAYPRO I</a> and later a KAYPRO II (CP/M based machines, not MS-DOS). I still remember thinking, ""what in the world am I going to do with 191kb of storage?"" when double-sided floppies came out. I was a hobbyist programmer, starting with BASIC and Turbo Pascal. When I was in college, I found a love for Organic Chemistry and ended up getting a Masters degree in Chemistry. During graduate school I met a guy that introduced me to his recruiter at Microsoft. I ended up getting job offers from a pharmaceutical company and Microsoft. The offer from Microsoft was too exciting to pass up even though it was less money. I spent ten years at Microsoft, five in Word (SDE) and five in SharePoint (SDET I/II).</p>

<p>I've been in software QA for almost 15 years doing both manual and automated testing. Over the years I've written automation in WordBasic and Word VBA but more recently C# and JavaScript. In the last six months or so at work, we changed our focus to Java and Selenium and I do a little C#/Selenium for tools here and there.</p>

<p>Over the years I've spent a lot of time reading blogs of LOTS of Q&amp;As on SO to learn and improve my knowledge of C#, JavaScript, Java, and Selenium. I don't know what I would have done without it. Reading blogs and articles is great but if you don't already know and/or trust the blogger, you may get bad info. SO isn't bullet proof but it's the only place I know of where you can get rated answers which really helps. There's not much you can't find on SO.</p>

Reasonably good at photography, computer stuff, a wee bit of maths, physics.  Studied Making Stuff Up and Not Using Common Sense at the University of Civil Service and later watching lawyers avoid common sense like the plague.  Would ban lawyers if (when) gain complete domination of world, pardoning Judge Judy on the basis she's not totally detached from reality.  Addicted to chocolate.</p>
<ul>
<li>Favorite program : Canada's Worst Driver.</li>
<li>Favorite book : Either &quot;Tinker, Tailor, Spy&quot; by John le Carré or one of the Disc World novels by Terry Pratchett.</li>
<li>Favorite Food : Is there anything better than Pepperoni Pizza ?  Surely not.  Only Domino can screw this up - a blind monkey could do better than Domino Pizza.</li>
<li>Most surprised by : Suicide By BrExit</li>
<li>Favorite Music : Jazz piano, even the weird stuff.</li>
<li>Least Favorite Music : It's a toss up between Irish Country and Western and Christian Rock.</li>
<li>Baffled By : Humans.  Dogs I understand (like kids without the talking back), even cats (just about the most self centered creatures until they invented overpaid footie players).  Humans remain a mystery wrapped in a soft, squishy shell.</li>
<li>Favorite sport : Real Football (i.e. the one where you're supposed to <em>only</em> kick the ball with a few exceptions, not pick it up and run).</li>
<li>Least Favorite Sport : Golf.  At least doing it is exercise, but <em>watching it ?!?!</em></li>
<li>Favorite equation : The Ideal Gas Law - this thing just never stops being useful.</li>
<li>Religion : Devout and committed Atheist.</li>
<li>Politics : Democracy - keep it until we figure out something not as crazy.</li>
<li>Favorite Comedian : An impossible choice between the late Dave Allen and the surprisingly still alive Dara O'Brien.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bucket List :</p>
<ul>
<li>Clone Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Marry cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Divorce cloned Sigourney Weaver</li>
<li>Clone Catherine Hicks</li>
<li>Live In Sin with clone of Catherine Hicks (lots and lots of sin)</li>
<li>Secretly think about cloned Sigourney Weaver while with cloned Catherine Hicks, but at least feel guilty about this.</li>
<li>Be sued jointly by real Catherine Hicks and real Sigourney Weaver for the cloning without permission thing.  Would that be theft or what ?</li>
<li>Die</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm fairly confident I'll manage at least one of those.</p>

The hardest part was understanding how variables worked. This was in the time before you could go to the internet to answer any question because google didn't exist yet, and I didn't know where to look. I remeber vividly tossing the Java step by step book frustrated in a corner because it was that little understanding that hindered me from understanding the rest. It lay there for 4-6 months until suddenly, when I had all but forgotten about it it clicked in my head and I understood how variables worked. I got the book up and started reading, and suddenly I could understand how it worked, how it translated and a world opened for me.</p>
<p>The year that followed I learned, Java, Perl, HTML, JavaScript, C++, Visual Basic, PHP and possibly a few other programming languages I have forgotten about. It was the basis for my understanding the digital world. A couple of projects I remember making are a forum, a remake of pokemon in javascript with map creator, a room walk through like you happen to see on a lot of house buying websites, a direct x 7 game in C++, a book record keeper in java to keep track of the books I had.</p>
<p>From there I kept doing a couple of hobby projects off and on, started several relatively successful fora and stopped them when the trolls found them and turned the entire place toxic and stressful, had some websites for fun where I would gather jokes, that site had a lot of CSS things in it I had experimented with, another was to gather and display poems. I discontinued them at some point because I didn't wish to pay for the server costs anymore for sites that I rarely used anymore and didn't have that many users/visitors.</p>
<p>I was able to get a job at a company as a programmer and there my skills deepened by having more contact with other programmers and learning about other possibilities and how to cooperate with them, take the lead in some aspects, and follow the lead in others.
After that job I went on to another job where even more responsibility was put on my shoulder by transforming a static html site that was updated by frontpage into a dynamic responsive website, without a team to fall back on. This was a pretty challenging thing because I had to combine a lot of varied items into one coherent thing.</p>
<p>During these jobs I also started coding a Minecraft Mod, Magic Cookies and had great fun exploring how to expand Minecraft functionality with my ideas. Basically the entire mod is a test bed of me trying to see what is possible within Minecraft code. I had great fun figuring out how large structures are rendered like nether temples and recreated my own with my dark temple that spawns in the nether, the same way a nether structure does, without having to rely on chunks being loaded like normal spawning of buildings do.</p>

work on and conform to project guidelines. I do not like to hack
them apart and bolt them back together in a frankensteins monster
mess.</li>
<li><p>I'm not a ninja. This means I take the time to understand a problem
before I sit down to write methodical code. Taking the ninja slice
and dice with wild abandon route always ends in pain and errors. </p></li>
<li><p>I'm not a wizard. I don't use magic numbers, variables or any other
mountain of bad practices if I can help it and I don't write code
that takes a conjurer of tricks to understand.</p></li>
<li><p>I'm not a rock star, I don't need my ego massaging and I don't want to be the center of attention.</p></li>
</ol>

<p><strong>What I am</strong></p>

<ol>
<li>I'm a reasonably well rounded software engineer and web developer. </li>
<li>I get the job done and I get the job done to the best of my abilities. I enjoy helping others and I like that there are others out there who can help me. </li>
<li>I like quiet environments that are rich in caffeine resources, fast broadband and good knowledgeable people.</li>
<li>More than anything, I love solving problems using the scientific approach.</li>

We envision buildings as giant robots, and believe that more efficient control of these intricate systems can significantly reduce energy demand globally.</p>
<p>Formerly, I was a member of the <a href=""https://www.tensorflow.org/swift"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Swift for TensorFlow</a> team at Google, exploring how machine learning could be advanced by integrating first-class support for differentiability into the Swift language. Many items we built there, such as differentiable Swift, live on in open source (differentiable Swift is a key component of our products at PassiveLogic).</p>
<p>Prior to that, I was the CEO and cofounder of <a href=""http://www.sonoplot.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SonoPlot, Inc.</a> SonoPlot manufactures and sells robotic systems for the printed electronics and biological research markets. I also used to do Mac and iOS development on the side via my one-man company <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sunset Lake Software</a>, with a particular focus on the iPhone and iPad.</p>
<p>I released an open-source molecular modeler for Mac and iOS called <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/molecules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Molecules</a>, and plan to open source my former equation editor called <a href=""http://www.sunsetlakesoftware.com/picubed"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Pi Cubed</a> as well. I'm the author of an open source framework called <a href=""https://github.com/BradLarson/GPUImage2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">GPUImage</a> which lets you perform GPU-accelerated filtering of images and video on Mac, iOS, and Linux.</p>
<p>I also taught a course on advanced iPhone development at the Madison Area Technical College, for which the fall and spring semesters' videos can be found on <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewCourse?id=497193807&amp;s=143441&amp;ls=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">iTunes U</a>.

If one examines the structural paradigm of discourse, one is faced with a choice: either reject the semiotic paradigm of reality or conclude that the Constitution is part of the fatal flaw of culture.  However, textual desituationism suggests that reality <em>is capable of truth.</em><br>
The characteristic theme of dialectic dematerialism is the role of the observer as poet. However, we may deconstruct surrealism to conclude that “Sexual identity is dead,” as Marx said. But in fact it is the opposite:  rather the stasis, and eventually the economy, of sexual identity, that is not feeling so well.</p>

<p>J’avais passé longtemps dans l’étude des sciences abstraites et le peu de communication qu’on en peut avoir m’en avait dégoûté. Quand j’ai commencé l’étude de l’homme, j’ai vu que ces sciences abstraites ne sont pas propres à l’homme, et que je m’égarais plus de ma condition en y pénétrant que les autres en l’ignorant. J’ai pardonné aux autres d’y peu savoir, mais j’ai cru trouver au moins bien des compagnons en l’étude de l’homme et que c’est le vrai étude qui lui est propre. J’ai été trompé. Il y en a encore moins qui l’étudient que la géométrie. Ce n’est que manque de savoir étudier cela qu’on cherche le reste. Mais n’est‑ce pas que ce n’est pas encore là la science que l’homme doit avoir, et qu’il lui est meilleur de s’ignorer pour être heureux.</p>

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
Now is better than never.
Although never is often better than *right* now.
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

Lifelong learning is a positive philosophy for life, a person should never stop learning especially now that information is so widely available. Wild and fantastic ideas interest me, especially when some plausibility exists for them. It is difficult to truly know what is possible without exploring what is happening at the limits of human knowledge. Overlapping areas of science, computation, technology and engineering are without a doubt the most interesting subject areas. A single approach to achievement can rarely accomplish what integrated approaches can, so the rare multidisciplinary projects which mankind has embarked upon have yielded the most interesting results. At one time, computers were merely theoretical, and shortly before that electricity and the atom. In a short time, the wild and fantastic theories of old have become accepted and everyday parts of our reality. Our need to explore as humans should keep driving us forward to parts unknown.</p>

<p>The start of my programming career came from my time served in the US Army. I was a 25U - <em>Signal Support System Specialist</em>.<br>
While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

He has been a programmer for 30+ years, and still keeps himself up-to-date with cutting-edge technologies, such as blockchain (mainly Hyperledger Fabric and Ethereum), functional programming (in Scala, Erlang, Java, etc.), asynchronous I/O (with Go a.k.a. Golang, JavaScript on Node.js, etc.), NoSQL (with Redis, MongoDB, DynamoDB, CouchDB, etc.), and cloud platforms (mainly AWS and IBM Cloud a.k.a. Bluemix), to handle today’s challenge of tamper resistance, multicore utilization, massive concurrency, and horizontal scalability.</p>

<p>Kenji has 10+ years of work experience in the Information Technology industry, 3 years of which in a management position. He rescued several startup companies from months of unproductiveness and years of improper practices, and helped them to get on track in a year. Please check his career portfolio below for information about projects involved (connection, i.e. friend status, is needed).</p>

<p>Kenji likes working in a UNIX environment, partly because he makes heavy use of the command line. He aligns with the UNIX philosophy of compositing small units that are testable, debuggable, benchmark-able and improvable. He is good at data modeling (with OOP, SQL, NoSQL, etc.) and implementing domain-specific languages (DSLs).</p>

The software is based on linear and nonlinear model predictive control algorithms which in turn combine algorithms for 1) state estimation and 2) optimal control/dynamic optimization. The software is aimed at a large variety of processes, including processes in 1) biotech, 2) cement plants, 3) oil production, and many others.</p>

<p>In 2018, I received a PhD degree in Applied Mathematics with focus on scientific computing from the Technical University of Denmark (DTU) where I have previously obtained a MSc in Mathematical Modeling and Computation as well as a BSc in Mathematics and Technology.</p>

<p>During my PhD, I worked on computationally efficient algorithms and software for nonlinear model predictive control, optimal control/dynamic optimization, and state estimation of semi-explicit index-1 DAEs with a focus on phase equilibrium processes, e.g. 1) compositional reservoir flow, 2) distillation columns, and 3) flash separation. It is natural to formulate models of such processes using DAEs in this semi-explicit form.</p>

<p>Aside from stuff pertaining to MSE, I occasionally speedrun (<a href=""https://www.speedrun.com/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>) or grind on RetroAchievements (<a href=""https://retroachievements.org/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>), and run several Discord servers. I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>
<p>So far academically, I graduated from undergrad in the spring of 2019 and currently am in grad school. I also study topics on my own a fair bit, especially over breaks; recently, I've been studying from Apostol's <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>. I still feel have a long way to go before I can call myself a &quot;master&quot; of any sort of mathematics, but if nothing else I feel like I have a quite broad knowledge pool that's stoked more interests than I can reasonably pursue in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Currently my personal inclinations lie towards algebraic topics (e.g. abstract algebra, category theory) but I've had quite an extensive look in analytic topics due to my coursework (especially real analysis, measure theory, functional analysis, and PDE theory). Ultimately, though, all math is cool and beautiful and I have a deep appreciation for all of it.</p>

I’ve lost almost $300$ games. $26$ times I’ve been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I’ve failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed. —Michael Jordan</p>
<p>Study actively. Don’t just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?-Halmos</p>
<p>To be a mathematician you must love mathematics more than family, religion, money, comfort, pleasure, glory.-Halmos</p>
<p>“A man must love a thing very much if he not only practices it without any hope of fame or money, but even practices it without any hope of doing it well.” – G.K. Chesterton</p>
<p>&quot;Many people say that it is the intellect which makes a great scientist. They are wrong: it is character.&quot; -- Albert Einstein</p>
<p>A person who never made a mistake never tried anything new.--Albert Einstein</p>
<p>In mathematics you don’t understand things. You just get used to them.-John von Neumann</p>
<p>A mathematician is a blind man in a dark room looking for a black cat which isn’t there!-Charles Darwin</p>
<p>We must know — we will know!---David Hilbert</p>
<p>&quot;Mathematics reveals its secrets only to those who approach it with pure love, for its own beauty&quot;- <strong>Archimedes</strong></p>
<p>The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal themselves in all their beauty only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it-<strong>Carl Friedrich Gauss</strong></p>
<p>The scientist does not study nature because it is useful; he studies it because he delights in it, and he delights in it because it is beautiful.-<strong>Henri Poincare</strong></p>
<p>The memory of God will not come to the selfish man. - Vivekananda</p>
<p>A sign of a great mathematician is that you can actually read and understand their proofs.</p>
<p>“Ever tried. Ever failed. No matter. Try again. Fail again. Fail better.” - <strong>Beckett</strong></p>
<p>It’s also good to remember that professional mathematics is not a sport (in sharp contrast to mathematics competitions). The objective in mathematics is not to obtain the highest ranking, the highest “score”, or the highest number of prizes and awards; instead, it is to increase understanding of mathematics (both for yourself, and for your colleagues and students), and to contribute to its development and applications. For these tasks, mathematics needs all the good people it can get.- <strong>Terence Tao</strong></p>
<p>Write down every definition, every theorem, and every proof. The definitions and theorems should be produced verbatim from the book since it is important to ensure that your understanding of the rigor is correct. However, the proofs should be written in your own words. -AD</p>
<p>Life is like a boxing bout.You are not lost when you fall down, you are lost when you refuse to get up.- <strong>Muhammad Ali</strong></p>

<h1>Pronouns: She/Her/Hers (but I don't mind they/them -- don't stress out!)</h1>

<p><strong>I approve of using indicated pronouns; I disapprove of SE (1) firing a Jewish Moderator right before high holidays with no notice and (2) slandering her as a bigot in newspapers.</strong></p>

<p>I just am trying to make it easier to document our organization-specific applications for JAWS users (a screen-reader), MAGic users (a screen magnifier), and Dragon Command Users (often mobility impaired users).   Most of our end-users are keyboard-only. </p>

<p>We're normally stuck in Microsoft Office, but we are expanding to some DAISY Digital Audio Book format (See <a href=""http://www.daisy.org/z3986/structure/SG-DAISY3/part2-major.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.daisy.org/z3986/structure/SG-DAISY3/part2-major.html</a>)</p>

<p>My goal is to simplify the documentation process by improving our templates, creating macros,  and automating anything possible!</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>(Oh, and I'm a HUGE fan of <strong>Wildbow's <a href=""https://parahumans.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Worm</a>/<a href=""https://www.parahumans.net/about/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Ward</a></strong> webserials , but none of my friends in real life are into it.   The ""<a href=""http://www.doofmedia.com/weve-got-ward/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">We've Got Ward</a>"" podcast helps, though.  )</p>

<hr>

<p>I'm working on my ""podcast empire"" -- as of today (May 7, 2019), things are still being migrated &amp; set up, but 2 major portions coming into being are 1) <strong>Alphabetical April</strong> (5 minute writing snippets) and 2) <strong>Pact</strong> (by wildbow) <em>Liveread</em> and <em>Audiobook</em>.   The Liveread is Tuesdays/Thursdays, 8PM EDST on <strong><a href=""http://mixlr.com/write-o-rama"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://mixlr.com/write-o-rama</a></strong> (archived on the showreel on Mixlr, but also distributed (soon) as a regular podcast.  The Edited Audiobook will be a few weeks delayed behind that, but also a podcast.  </p>

<p>Update as of Oct 1 -- Depression strikes again -- no updates, only one episode of ABC April is out. Sorry.<br>
<em>Update Oct 24: And apparently I lost my URL -- depression = missing renewal deadlines. sigh.</em></p>

<p><strong>my philosophy of teaching and learning:</strong></p>

<p>most important for teachers (and students):
 mind that there are different types of learners!</p>

<p><strong>four primary types of learners: visual, auditory, reading/writing, and kinesthetic</strong></p>

<p>methods:</p>

<p>relative tones, hand-signs, multi channel learning (s. types of learners)
learning by doing, learning by trial and error, learning by problem solving and developing yourself, learning reading by writing, learning by trying to explain something to someone else, learning by asking a problem.</p>

<p>my most preferred methods in music are:</p>

<p><strong>reading by writing</strong> and <strong>playing by listening</strong>
the final goal will be <strong>sight-reading</strong> and <strong>improvising</strong> </p>

<p>= inventing and composing) that means:          <strong>MUSIC PLAYING IS SUPERLEARNING</strong></p>

<p>[Due to some limitations on SE, the following is an excerpt from the full version which can be found on <a href=""https://medium.com/@laterofstackexchange/about-stack-exchange-4ef7a662d910"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Medium</a> (bare URL: <code>https://medium.com/@laterofstackexchange/about-stack-exchange-4ef7a662d910</code>) or on <a href=""https://laterofstackexchange.substack.com/p/about-stack-exchange"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Substack</a> (bare URL: <code>https://laterofstackexchange.substack.com/p/about-stack-exchange</code>).]</p>
<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> If your main purpose of visiting Stack Exchange is knowledge exchange and you do not want to experience disturbance and disappointment on this platform, come to this platform <strong>ONLY</strong> for knowledge exchange and nothing else.</p>
<p>If I had to visit just one place on the web, Stack Exchange (SE) would certainly be my only choice. Why? The answer has nothing to do with the SE platform's facilities and functionality. What drives me to this platform is in fact the knowledge exchange and repository (the &quot;main&quot; part of SE) resulting from many people's contribution to SE over more than a decade.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the &quot;meta&quot; part of SE has a whole different story. By &quot;meta&quot; I mean the set of any activity on SE except the knowledge exchange, including moderation, policies, norms, post voting, closure, deletion, editing, etc.. Not making this writing tedious, I will not provide details and evidence. However, I want to share my many years' experience with SE so that those whose main concern is only to exchange knowledge will unlikely encounter disturbing situations during their activity on SE (Although the following points are based upon interaction with two specific SE communities, Math Stack Exchange and Meta Stack Exchange, their application can be extended to other SE communities due to the essential common features SE communities have validating these points):</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Freedom of speech is not a granted right to SE users.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>Do not care about meta actions on posts.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>Stay away from meta sites as far as possible.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>Stay away from moderators as far as possible.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>Stay away from the SE community managers as far as possible.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>Obligatory norms of a community can be very different from the written guidelines.</strong></em> ...</li>
<li><em><strong>SE is not the only means of knowledge exchange.</strong></em> ...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Notice</strong>: My inactivity on the Stack Exchange platform for more than 14 days would signal my death. Until then please tolerate me.</p>

<p>A popular and well-respected volunteer network moderator, Monica Cellio, <a href=""https://judaism.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5193"">was terminated without warning</a> and <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/334133"">portrayed to the press as misgendering trans people</a> by Stack Overflow, Inc. All signs suggest this was an erroneous, if not malicious, decision not founded on fact, which the company is completely failing to take any responsibility for. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/333965"">This has caused an enormous and ongoing uproar in the community.</a></p>

<p>Monica and the community have been quite literally <strong>begging</strong> for <em>some</em> kind of response from the company either opening up a path to reinstatement, or justifying their decision to terminate her, for more than a month now. She's made many good-faith offers to talk, and others have offered to mediate (and made <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=monica"">dozens of constructive suggestions on how to resolve the situation</a>). Several members of the Lavender community have spoken up on her behalf, e.g. in <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336731"">this prominent post</a>.</p>

<p>So far, Stack Overflow, Inc. has met all of this with thunderous silence. As a long-time contributor and someone always willing to see the good in the company's and its employees' actions and assume good faith, I'm still struggling to come to terms with the corporate callousness of this behaviour which we have to assume now is the new normal.</p>

<p><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336526"">Having exhausted all other means of communication,</a> Monica is now raising funds for potential legal action to clear her name. This is in her own interest, but arguably also in the interest of the SO community at large. While only the libel is likely to be legally actionable, it might establish at least <em>some</em> boundaries to what the company can do to its volunteers, as well as be a symbolic slap in the face of a business that appears to have lost all respect for the community that keeps it alive.</p>

<p>I have complete trust the funds will be used well and anything left over (say because they decide to do the right thing after all and legal action becomes unnecessary) will go toward good causes. </p>

<p><strong><a href=""https://www.gofundme.com/f/stop-stack-overflow-from-defaming-its-users"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Consider supporting her today.</a></strong></p>

Although I appreciate the work of many thinkers in the History of Ideas, Spinoza's masterwork, the ""Ethics"" and its accompanying treatise ""On the Improvement of the Understanding"" mark Spinoza as truly unique in the History of Philosophy. His discoveries concerning Ontology, Metaphysics, 
Psychology, Ethics and Religion and Politics remain largely unrecognized.
The unity of thought and cohesion of structure within his system render his thinking as the most comprehensively presented portrait of the entire panoply of existence. His understanding of the nature of Divinity and of Human's place in the continuing evolution of everything possible requires a life-time of dedication to fully appreciate. 
The work required to bring his massive accomplishments to the attention of the widest audience possible will require the participation of as many like minded souls as possible who are willing to assist. The resurgence in Spinoza research and explosion of commentary within the extant, indicate that something important is afoot.
The upshot of all of this is that this quiet scholar who lived on the edges of seventeenth century Nederland has delivered to the world a blueprint for shaping the future of Humanity. Please join us in this most worthwhile project!

<p>If you get stuck, get away from your desk. Take a walk, take a bath, go to sleep, make a pie, draw, listen to ­music, meditate, exercise; whatever you do, don't just stick there scowling at the problem. But don't make telephone calls or go to a party; if you do, other people's words will pour in where your lost words should be. Open a gap for them, create a space. Be patient.</p>

My favorite topics in English Language &amp; Usage include the history of the English language (including single word requests), descriptive linguistics, the formation and deflation of standard dialects, rhetoric, and anything requiring archival or corpus research. I like to get my hands dirty with words, and think there is inherent value in trying to explain how language functions.</p>

<p><strong>Dialect</strong> </p>

<p>I am American. Based on self-assessments, my dialect shares features with Southern American English and Appalachian English. However, I show thorough intermixing with the Midwestern dialects common in oral media, and my education has effectively standardized my speech and writing save in contexts where I deliberately code-switch for emphasis. In accent, I can put on a few accents faithfully but otherwise I'm hard to place. I've been called English while in the UK and just about everything while in the US. </p>

<p>I took <a href=""https://www.pri.org/stories/2015-07-21/accent-quiz-swept-english-speaking-world"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this quiz</a> and used my imperfect IPA skills (and frequent reference to dictionaries) to represent how I think I pronounce several words. Three things I found:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I'm pretty noncomittal when multiple pronunciations are possible. I still switch up caramel. </p></li>
<li><p>Sometimes the lines between, say, /a/, /ɑ/ and /æ/ or between /ɪ/ and /ɛ/, are pretty flexible. (I don't think I distinguish pin and pen, for instance.) </p></li>
<li><p>For words with an optional /j/ (like after the /k/ in coupon), I tend to omit them unless I'm speaking very slowly for emphasis. </p></li>

<p>“[Mathematics is] only real when shared”
― Jon Krakauer, Into the Wild</p>
<p><strong>My new favorite book:</strong></p>
<p><a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/019875891X"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Theories, Sites, Toposes; by Olivia Caramello</a></p>
<p><em>It is unbelievably readable for modern graduate students or those familiar with basic Category Theory.   This is in contrast to the difficulty one has when they start up Johnstone's books.
Olivia Caramello is a super hero of mathematics.</em></p>

<p>If you feel that Innovation and Automation are missing or not working as expected in your organization, something must change ! Maybe the words to save FTEs sound familiar to you .</p>
<p>I’ve been in those shoes when I didn’t save enough FTEs or lacked innovation in my solutions. What did I do? I reskilled, adapted, and accomplished results beyond expectations.

Voi is uncomfortable with the gender-specific pronouns 'he' and 'she', not because voi dislikes voids gender assigned at birth, but because it is irrelevant noise and none of anyone's business.</p>

<p>Furthermore, people are less like individuals and more like elements of a collective, certainly users at StackExchange sites. The use of dualistic pronouns like 'I', 'we' and 'you' do not reflect the transcendental nature of this site (and society as a whole). Voi therefore prefer to use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself also for first and second person pronouns.</p>

<p>Please use voi/void/voids/voids/voidself when referring to void. Not everyone has the same worldview, so it is not offending to void if voi uses other pronouns when referring to voidself. Voi will use preferred pronouns when referring to others if known.</p>

I use Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04 and 19.04 with my little paws (believe me). I generally give instructions to my master to write up answers or ask questions as I dictate him (typing could be boring sometimes).</p>

<p>I am actually a researcher.  I worked 17 odd years in medical research and mainly on databases.  Research relies on databases, otherwise I get the question, &quot;How is medical research related to IT?&quot;.</p>
<p>Well, I constructed those dumb questionnaires, by first researching all the validity stuff for quality data, which never is absolute but somewhat indicative at its time.</p>
<p>Then, I built their databases for myself and other groups, and gathered statistics to be published.</p>
<p>So after studying computer science, I studied some medical science and now back to computer science.</p>
<p>My latest interest is learning networking.</p>
<p>I am a slow learner.  I take my time.</p>
<p>Since 10+ years, I am self-employed.  I travel to Germany for projects, yes I speak German.</p>
<p>One of my passions is creating automation in a work environment.  Meaning, I learn about this new business, plan on how to make it optimal, built scenarios and slowly set up the information technology for better use.</p>
<p>My website is not nearly informative of all the work I do, because of 'Not enough time!'.</p>

He studied and graduated from the  University of Kharkiv National Academy of Municipal Economy in 1995 with BSc and MSc degrees in Engineering. His PhD thesis was on &quot;The Potential Impacts of Light Rail Transit on Travel Behaviour&quot;.
In the research, a method borrowed from social psychology called the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Multinomial Logit Model was used. From the Theory, according to Icek Ajze (1985 and 1987), states that, human action is guided by three kinds considerations: behavioural beliefs, normative beliefs and control beliefs. All behaviour is determined by intention to carry it out. Intention is a function of three factors: attitude toward the Behaviour, subjective norm and perceived behavioural control. The combination of these three lead to the formation of behavioural intention.
Let's apply the Theory of Planned Behaviour. The person attitude, perceptions of what other people think and perceptions of how easy an action is to carry out, determines whether someone will choose to carry out the given behaviour, such as, commuting or travelling with the light rail transit system (LUAS). The Irish LUAS system is a dynamic traffic mode, that will potentially impacts on  the people's travel behaviour and generates more trips.</p>

<p>My main professional goal is to stablish an academic career in Earth Sciences, in which I will balance research, teaching and mentoring, to ensure the advance of the field. My main
research focus is to understand the dynamics of subduction and mantle convection and its
geological and geophysical implications (e.g., volcanism, mountain building and Earth’s water budget). To that end, I use state of the art numerical modeling in combination with the most recent observations. I strive to make my classroom an inclusive and challenging environment where students can thrive, by including modern pedogeological methodologies. Mentoring new students is a crucial part of my role as a scientist, and I will continue helping form outstanding young scientists.</p>

<p>I've read plenty of books that were perfectly worth their time, and I've read plenty of books that I didn't want to put down. I think yours may be the first that I kept putting down because I just didn't want it to end. Every five or ten pages--not even every story!--I'd walk away and do something else just so I could live a while with this new bit of amazing bouncing around in me.</p>

My research interests are lying in the area of high-voltage engineering, plasma surface modification of polymers and electrostatic applications. In particular, I am interested in contributing to the improvement of triboelectric charging of plastic granular materials using dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma surface treatment under atmospheric conditions. The central motivating theme of my research is the study and exploitation of electric charges generated by insulating materials in electrostatic processes: the use of surface plasma modification in atmospheric conditions to promote electrostatic charges generated by treated insulating materials. My previous research demonstrated the importance of surface plasma treatment of granular materials prior their triboelectric charging in improvement of electrostatic separation processes outcome in terms of recovery rates and purity of the separated products. The significance of my research contributions has been demonstrated in 3 accepted and published journal papers, 5 international conferences papers, 1 accepted and published proceedings paper, and 1 national conference paper. My research papers have been cited for 22 times, and my current h-index is 2.</p>

<p>I like to draw. I like to write poems and stories. I love to do science. I also love to play the melodica.</p>
<h2>History</h2>
<p>I came here as an unsuspecting 10th grader who wanted to share <a href=""https://silver-cordi-5.tiiny.site"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this revolutionary idea</a> that the universe was a water tap. It was the result of several weeks of experimenting, theorizing, and making deep connections between many fancy words I had gathered from many YouTube channels and pop science TV shows. Most of my classmates found it interesting, and some of them were so amazed at the level of my thinking. So I finally decided to disseminate this idea to the world through this site :)</p>
<p>That question didn't end up nicely, of course, but that was my first introduction to what science was. Like many millennials, I came to know about science due to the science shows they have on Nat geo and Discovery. And also those cool illustrated DK science books (<em>I love those DIY science experiments!</em>).</p>
<p>Truly, this site has been <strong>so</strong> influential in my life. From enabling me to see and feel science in everything around me, to helping me choose which path to take after school. I am now pursuing a PhD in Physics. I must say, this site has been a huge factor in giving me the courage to take up science.</p>
<h2>Nice resources</h2>
<ol>
<li><p><a href=""https://physlets.org/tracker/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tracker</a> is a nifty free software for extracting data points from a video. You have to select the points manually, but the final result will be worth the effort!</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://scratch.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Scratch</a> is a brilliant program that lets you do almost anything (and it's free). I love to make physics simulations in Scratch.</p>
</li>
<li><p><a href=""https://myscope.training/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Myscope</a> is an awesome resource for learning about different microscopy methods. They have good materials, assessments, and my favorite, cool virtual labs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h2>Nice quotes:</h2>
<p><em><strong>Let noble thoughts come to us from every side</strong></em> - Rig Veda (<em>Also the motto of <a href=""http://www.bvbpottore.com/about.php"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">my school</a></em>)</p>
<p><em><strong>Nature does not hurry, yet everything is accomplished</strong></em> - Lao Tsu</p>

I moved on to acquire the skills to become a Math Curriculum Specialist with an emphasis on online item writing, which opened the door to coding.</p>
<p>Using <strong>HTML, CSS, JS, LaTeX</strong>, and <strong>MathML</strong>, I was enlightened and finally thrilled with the work I was doing and the skills I was learning. I knew I was starting on the right path to a lifelong career.</p>
<p>So here I am, currently enrolled in an excellent boot camp out of UNC-Chapel Hill and partnered with Trilogy and developing the first stages of my portfolio while getting my feet wet using.</p>

I always try to get them hiking, biking, to the beach, to the zoo. They in turn try to get me to take them places like birthday parties, go karting, or jump at one of those trampoline places that smells like a sweaty gym (they are fun, I must admit. But stay out of the foam pits and just jump. Trust me on this.)</p>
<p>In my work I am an unlicensed ME and was previously an electronics technician. I've spent ~15 years in a role that should be filled by a power systems EE.</p>
<p>I work in unusual voltages, tolerances, conversions, and configurations. For example 115V three phase delta 400Hz. There are no off the shelf products for this, not even at the airport (it's delta!).</p>
<p>Most of my field is outside the jurisdiction of the NEC, FAA, SOLAS, and many others, but safety is still important. Every reg has to be deeply understood so we make a wise choice regarding when to follow it and when to blow it off. We can't follow them all though, and don't attempt to. We are able to write our own rules when needed, but they must be justified, well reasoned, and documented.</p>
<p>Somehow I manage to do all that but I have trouble carrying out small projects at home. I'm not handy. I suck at home improvement. Nothing in a house is ever level, plumb, or square. Nothing ever fits right. One must have craftsmanship, patience, and experience, but I lack all of those. We should have bought a condo. Seriously.</p>
<p>During covid I discovered that I like mountain biking so I splurged a bit on a fairly high end aluminum hardtail. I don't trust carbon fiber, but in hindsight I should have gotten the full suspension. I initially thought I just wanted to ride fire roads but that quickly escalated to real trail riding. I am fortunate to have a few good trails just a few minutes away and many more within an hours drive. It is my drug now, for sure. And my pants fit better.</p>
<p>I like SE HNQs. It has real people who are not trolls or cranks or bots. I like the high quality questions and answers and the wide variety of topics. It has helped me in my professional and personal life, like having life coaches I trust. And I get to learn from listening to them talking to their other customers also.</p>
<p>I am found nowhere on the internet except SE and Imgur. No socials.</p>

<p>$${\text{I was an explorer :-( }}$$</p>
<p>Some quotes closer to my heart:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The spirit of a student is destroyed every time whenever learning is bound by the school and curriculum.- Wolgwang</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>If you tell me, I will listen. If you show me, I will see. But if you let me experience, I will learn.—Lao Tsu</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Math is a language, and I want to &quot;read&quot; it (not &quot;recite&quot;, i.e. like we can recite medieval German hymns). I need the message behind the definitions.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you understand something, then you can find the math to express that understanding. The math doesn't provide the understanding.-Leslie Lamport</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Imagination is more important than knowledge.—Albert Einstein</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose we do not know the rules of chess but are allowed to watch the moves of the players. If we watch the game for a long time, we may make out some of the rules. With the knowledge of these rules, we may try to understand why a player played a particular move.<em>Physics</em> goes the same way. The nature around us is like a big chess game played by Nature. The events in nature are like the moves of the great game. We are allowed to watch the events of nature and guess at the basic rules according to which the events take place.-Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>You can know the name of a bird in all the languages of the world, but when you’re finished, you’ll know absolutely nothing whatever about the bird… So let’s look at the bird and see what it’s doing — that’s what counts. I learned very early the difference between knowing the name of something and knowing something. —Richard Feynman</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To teach effectively a teacher must develop a feeling for his subject; he cannot make his students sense its vitality if he does not sense it himself. He cannot share his enthusiasm when he has no enthusiasm to share. How he makes his point may be as important as the point he makes; he must personally feel it to be important. —George Póyla</p>

I also know HTML, CSS, and JS, and have taken Java courses at my local community college.</p>
<p>I used to moderate on this site, specifically during the covid times. I remember vividly, during zoom meetings in history class, I would be going through review queues , chatting in the chatrooms, answering questions on MSO and MSE (meta stack overflow and meta stack exchange), and participating in the charcoal project (Smoke Detector). It was fun at the time, but it's lost time that I'll never get back. I quit around 2022 for personal reasons, and the experience taught me better English, maturity (because I wasn't very mature in my interactions, I was a 14 year old), and the value of time.</p>
<p>My interest particularly lies in space research. Space research is a vast field, and I am experimenting with Python and AI and it's applications in astronomy. I capture my own astronomical data from my backyard and I use Python to aid in the stacking and processing of this data, however lately I've been looking into the usage of a supervised or even reinforcement learning model which can identify Poisson noise and other noise from gradients (full moon) and the gradients themselves, and filter them out through some sort of CNN (Convolutional Neural Network). My interest in astronomy spans beyond this but this particular aspect of it is what is relevant to computer programming.</p>
<p>In my free time I enjoy tinkering with Tkinter (get it?) and am working on a personal calendar app created mostly from scratch (only module I use is datetime which gives me the current date). It's proving much more challenging but I have a playlist dedicated to showing the progress I'm making (link coming soon) and the GitHub repository if you wish to try it for yourself: <a href=""https://github.com/closinator/CalendarAppTkinter/tree/main"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/closinator/CalendarAppTkinter/tree/main</a></p>

I took a basic probability theory course that went through the first few chapters of Casella-Berger but that's it. Eventually I think I'd like to get a graduate degree in math or stats but I'm enjoying working and paying off loans in the mean time.

<hr />
<p>School student who has learnt almost all their maths/computer science informally from the internet, who enjoys helping others and likes to challenge everything; every statement must be proven, where possible. Using this site to learn for myself, and to help others learn, as I have enjoyed doing both my whole life.</p>
<p>Piano student of the master Lubomyr Melnyk, for about two years now. You can see me play his pieces with dubious quality <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6JyL4DYJNpAufYLnezGRWA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>A free collection of many of his works is viewable <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC71UEL2KfKIC0M7TQ5mKhsA"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. Scores to learn from may be found <a href=""https://www.erasedtapes.com/product/erasm007-continuous-music-selected-works"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> and <a href=""https://lubomyrmelnyk.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>. His online persona is often attacked by critics on the grounds of arrogance, but this is blind (imho): he is the only human alive, perhaps the only who has ever lived, who can actually play his music. He has been a pioneer for some $50$ years now, but has been largely ignored. He is a lovely, humble man in person (perhaps not so great at communicating online) and an excellent teacher: should any keen pianist buy scores for his pieces, I highly recommend lessons. You will not get far with the traditional classical playing technique. Continuous music is a brilliant world of sound, and I fervently hope that some student of his carries on the great work (that is my motivation for adding this to my profile, that a pianist might take interest and be successful). You don't need to be very good at first - I wasn't - in order to pick up his music to a ok level, just dedicated: but to play anything <em>properly</em>, you need to be amazing... hopefully we can learn!</p>
<p>I promise you have not heard anything like it.</p>

<p>I use code automation and generation techniques to solve ERP and CMS style application development issues am active in Windows Insider, Visual Studio and VS AddIn Open Source communities. When I'm bored, I trawl StackOverflow for inspiration and the opportunity to flex my skills or try out new frameworks in an effort to help out my fellow developers.</p>
<p>I've been involved professionally in IT since 2002, starting off as a C#/SQL Developer, but long before that I have been working with robotics and automation systems to solve seemingly impractical and unnecessary tasks around the house. It took nearly 15 years to find a professional use for these skills in the realm of Industrial IoT, interfacing with PLCs, microcontrollers and SoCs like Raspberry Pi, mostly from the comfort of C#.</p>
<p>I'm a strong believer of making use of existing tools if they were intended to be used for your purpose, don't try to re-purpose them to suit your needs now because you will soon find that your needs and the intentions of the designer of the tool will forever frustrate your efforts at an exponential rate until you finally give up and buy the right tool, or make your own.</p>
<p>I've written my fair share of in-house software, when I look at the time spent and the lack of recognition that you get from yourself (it is never done) I've come to realise that it is a far better investment to buy the right software if it can be found and save the code for clients that will pay for it.</p>

<p>For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. For God sent not his Son into the world to condemn the world; but that the world through him might be saved. He that believeth on him is not condemned: but he that believeth not is condemned already, because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God. And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. (John 3:16-19)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness; and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. For the scripture saith, Whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed. For there is no difference between the Jew and the Greek: for the same Lord over all is rich unto all that call upon him. For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How then shall they call on him in whom they have not believed? and how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a preacher? (Romans 10:9-14)</p>

El problema es que las necesidades son infinitas. Por otro lado, los derechos, alguien los tiene que pagar. Esto se logra mediante esa aberración llamada 'justicia social', que es injusta porque implica un trato desigual frente a la ley, pero además está precedida por un robo. Ese modelo que se traduce en fuerte déficit fiscal. De las veintidós crisis econónicas que tuvimos, veinte fueron de origen fiscal. Esto se traduce en crisis de endeudamiento. Y cuando ya no pueden financiar más con deuda, se traduce en defaults. Luego, recurren a la emisión monetaria. Y así le quitamos trece ceros a la moneda. Y cuando se les acaba el chiste de la maquinita, recurren a la suba de impuestos. BASTA de decadencia.”</p>
<p>“Aquellos países que son libres crecen más que el doble que aquellos que son reprimidos; su PBI per cápita es ocho veces mayor. El decil más bajo de la distribución está once veces mejor en los países libres que en los países reprimidos. Así, queda mucho más claro que es mejor ser cola de león que cabeza de ratón. En los países que abrazan las ideas de la libertad, la pobreza es veinticinco veces menor y la gente vive más!”</p>
<p>“Ya lo decía Jon Stuart Mill: ‘Aquella sociedad que priorice la igualdad por encima de la libertad se convierte en una sociedad de saqueadores. Aquella que haga lo contrario va a conseguir mucho de ambas cosas’.”</p>
<p>“Nos encontramos frente a una discusión de valores. Por un lado el socialismo, basado en la envidia, el odio, el resentimiento, la desigualdad, el robo, y tratar de igualar a los que somos desiguales. En consecuencia, un sistema violento que siempre se aplicó a la fuerza y se llevó puesto más de cien millones de vidas humanas.”</p>
<p>“Por el otro lado, el liberalismo, que no es ni maś ni menos que el respeto irrestricto del proyecto de vida del prójimo, basado en: la propiedad privada, el libre mercado, la poca intervención del Estado, la división del trabajo y la cooperación social. Donde se premia el ahorro y se aprecia el esfuerzo. Todo esto sierviendo al prójimo con bienes de mejor calidad a un menor precio. Por esto, el exitoso en el capitalismo es un benefactor social.”</p>

Three years ago, it'd have been a fullstack <code>javascript</code> answer with some <code>scala</code> on the side. A year ago, <code>rust</code> on microcontrollers would've been my daily bread. Tomorrow, who knows what I may be doing :-)</p>

<p>I am all about building services that derive more value than the net sum of the parts they encompass. To this end, I am very interested in projects leveraging data to build a <em>better</em> world. My track record in fields such as social media analytics and IoT should highlight this, with cutting-edge solutions aimed at creating new possibilities.</p>

<p>I employ whatever technology and methodologies are fit for a project, on a project-by-project basis, and keep my full range of skills up to date at all times. If there is no requirement, however, I tend to default <code>javascript</code> or <code>rust</code>, one for its reach, the other for its performance, and TDD to provide meaningful, reliable, spec-compliant solutions.</p>

The current trend in physical therapy is to treat a high volume of patients, which results in less individual attention. During most one-hour treatments, a patient will only spend 15 minutes with a physical therapist because the therapist sees multiple patients simultaneously. Some of your treatment time is even spent with non-licensed aides and technicians doing exercises.</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a pro-tem moderator (♦) over on the <a href=""https://langdev.stackexchange.com/"">Programming Language Design and Implementation</a> StackExchange. If you need mod-help for that site, give me a ping in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/146046/the-garbage-collector"">The Garbage Collector</a>, the site's main chat room.</li>
<li>I'm also a code golfer - it's what hooked me into sticking around SE and getting more involved than posting occasional answers on SO.</li>
<li>As such, I've made a <a href=""https://www.github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">golfing language called Vyxal (original naming, I know, but I'm also a programmer cut me some slack naming things is hard)</a>. In a nutshell:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Vyxal is an stack-based esoteric array language that is dedicated to dominating competition in code golf challenges. This means that it strips away all need for boilerplate, long function names and impractical source layouts. However, it also has a more traditional and familiar way of expressing itself if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm currently in my 4th year of doing a Software Engineering degree, so that's something I'm doing with my life that isn't StackExchange.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One might say that I am somewhat of a memes enthusiast. That one would be correct, because I have that skibidi ohio rizz that all the fanum taxers mew about. Enjoy your lost brain cells.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a hobby of making AIs play chess when they really aren't designed to do so. Like that StackOverflow question formatting assistant thing. And v0 from Vercel. If you know of any other AIs that are jailbreakable and aren't designed to play chess (e.g. Fiverr neo - looking forward to getting my hands on that one), ping me in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/125050/the-edge-of-propinquity"">The Edge of Propinquity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My profile picture is generated using a wide mix of genai image tools including Wumbo Dream, Let's Enhance, getimg.ai and probably some other tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grammarly gave this bio a  emoji for tone. I don't know whether to be offended or to say to it &quot;uhm ackshully you're the nerd&quot;.</p>
</li>

<p>I have also designed <a href=""https://flatassembler.github.io/AEC_specification.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a programming language called AEC</a> and have written two compilers for it: <a href=""https://flatassembler.github.io/compiler.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">one written in JavaScript and targetting x86</a> and <a href=""https://aecforwebassembly.sourceforge.io/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the other one written in C++ and targetting WebAssembly</a>.

<p>My Bachelor Thesis is my <a href=""https://flatassembler.github.io/PicoBlaze/PicoBlaze.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PicoBlaze assembler and emulator written in JavaScript</a>. PicoBlaze is a small computer made by Xilinx, and we use it as an example of a simple computer at our laboratory exercises and auditory exercises in our Computer Architecture classes.

I am currently doing research in two fields: classical optics and quantum information; here's my <a href=""https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TG0YwP4AAAAJ&amp;hl=en"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google Scholar page</a>. My favorite subjects in physics and math are quantum mechanics and linear algebra, respectively. One shouldn't be surprised by my interest in quantum computing.</p>
<p>Optical coherence uses methods from statistics, Fourier analysis, functional analysis, and linear algebra to characterize correlation functions for partially coherent light. Partial coherence is a measure of how &quot;much&quot; interference would occur if two points of a beam were diffracted into the far-field. One expects that the sun, which has many sources (atoms), to produce partially coherent light (which it does).</p>
<p>The qudit Dicke states form the completely symmetric irreducible basis of <span class=""math-container"">$su(d)$</span>.  Methods from linear algebra, (algebraic) combinatorics, group theory, and Lie theory are used to characterize the Dicke states.</p>

<p><strong>Business Description
Orlando Thrive Therapy is a private-pay practice and payment is due at the time of your therapy service. We have made a very careful decision not to allow insurance to dictate how we provide services to treat you or who we are allowed to work with. We believe successful outcomes in therapy happen when you are seen as more than a diagnosis and a variety of therapeutic techniques can be offered at one time. If you still need to use the medical model for treatment, contact your insurance provider for more information. If you would like more information about how we work and our unique approach, please contact us for a free 10-15 minute consult so we can help you get started.</strong></p>
