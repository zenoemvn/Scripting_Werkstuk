I was wondering how can I help the site at this early stage. I thought about asking about how to get started with 3D printing but SE explicitly discourages ""easy"" questions in the private beta.

While it might be clear to the asker that he's talking about his home 3D printing machine, that's not necessarily the case for those that try to answer the question.

I think it would help to specify the scope of questions with tags, to allow future visitors to identify what type of 3D printer it is about. Answers to a lot of questions related to general properties of the printing process like printing speed, resolution, additional manual work, support structures, etc. depend heavily on the technology that's being used.

This also prevents ""Well, it depends..."" type of answers that cover a lot of possibly unrelated things.","2"

## What should our FAQ contain?

Much of the FAQ will be somewhat boilerplate: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from [the Definition phase of Area 51][2].

But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the FAQ.

Take the [Super User FAQ][3] as an example:

>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.

>If you have a question about …

> * computer hardware
> * computer software

> and it is **not about** …

> * videogames or consoles
> * websites or web services like Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
> * electronic devices, media players, cell phones or smart phones, except insofar as they interface with your computer
> * a shopping or buying recommendation

It took us almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues **specific to your topic and your community**.

## What should our documentation contain?

Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from [the Definition phase of Area 51][2].

Take the [Super User ""About"" page][3] as an example:

>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.

>Ask about...

> * Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking
> * Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered

>Don't ask about...

> * Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware
> * Questions that are primarily opinion-based
> * Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer
> * Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer
> * Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
> * Shopping, buying or product recommendations
> * Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks

These are then elaborated on in SU's [What topics can I ask about here?][4] page.

> About a week into the public beta, we will seek out members who are deeply engaged in the community’s development; members who:
> 
> - Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
> - Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.
> - Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.
> - Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in [*A Theory of Moderation*][2].
>
> Bonus points for:
>
> - Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).
> - Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.
> - Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.
>
>Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:
>
> - Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.
> - Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).
> - Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.
>
>Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**

Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:

- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.
- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.
- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.
- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.
- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. 
- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.

If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into [chat room][3] where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called [The Assembly](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly) was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.

Once again, **please don't hesitate to step up and self-nominate!**.

## What’s the “elevator pitch” for our site?

Imagine you’ve just gotten on an elevator with a friendly stranger. You have precisely one floor to describe your community to them. What would you say? The elevator pitch is a brief sentence that describes *what your site is about*. Every word counts!

Once decided, it can be sliced and diced to form:

* the tagline
* the motto
* the blurb under the logo
* a convenience redirect “nickname” for the site
* perhaps eventually the domain name [in some form][2]

(Due to a variety of [practical difficulties with domain names][3], we prefer to de-emphasize domain name selection. Most sites will retain their `topic.stackexchange.com` names indefinitely.)

Naming is hard — *really* hard. But if you can come up with a sensible elevator pitch for your community, it’s a great starting point.

 * How do I drill a hole in a 3D printed part?

 * How do I paint 3D printed parts?

 * How do I sand, smooth, etc...?

 * How do I take a picture with a 3D printed camera?

My last example is clearly not on topic, and the other examples aren't 

 > difficult, specific questions — the kind of questions pros and experts ask each other, not the kind of questions novices ask pros.

However, the point is that it's very easy to involve 3D printing in a question that isn't about 3D printing. Drilling a hole in a 3D printed part is, for the most part, just like drilling one in wood. Such questions may be more suited for a general DIY/makers-type site.

On the other hand, there do exist 3D printing specific issues (for instance, low infill or delamination can be a problem when drilling in a (FDM) 3D printed part).

At what point does a question involving 3D printing become on-topic for our site? Should questions identify a specific issue (""I've tried drilling a hole, now my part has delaminated, what now?"")?. Queries for general advice and best practice don't seem to fit the bill of being difficult and specific.","2"

Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:

- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.
- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.
- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.
- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.
- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. 
- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.

If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into [chat room][3] where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called [The Assembly](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly) was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.

Once again, **please don't hesitate to step up and self-nominate!**.

Enthusiasm is great in a private beta, but for the early stages, direct that enthusiasm towards the Q&A. That's what'll get this site on its feet and into a successful public beta.

When the site's more stable and running nicely, then if there's a need (or want) for a plugin like this then the discussion about it can be had.

The specific example I'm referring to is here: http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60

In many cases on SE, I see people post ""Answers"" that basically say ""Don't do what you're doing.  Instead you can get to your goal by doing this.""  While it is often helpful, this form of answer is the bane of my existence as a user of SE sites.

There are often cases when I am googling a difficult problem because I cannot do ""alternative a"" as suggested by the answerer.  Then, I get to an SE question that asked about exactly the situation I am having.  An answer of ""Don't do that, do this instead"" is upvoted, accepted, and the only answer.  Thus, I am unable to solve my problem using SE.  In other words, the Answer didn't apply to the question, and so SE led me down the wrong path.

Am I doing something wrong here?  Is this an expected/accepted pattern?  Or is this something I should go the route of downvoting?  Or like the poster of the above answer suggests, flagging?","2"

Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.**


This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) [post on meta.hermeneutics.SE](http://meta.hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/49); I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.

> I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
> 
> 
> ###Vote on Questions
> Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
> 
> If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
> 
Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)
> 
> ###Vote on Answers
> Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
> 
> *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*
> 
> To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).
> 
If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!
> 
> If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.
> 
> ###Final thoughts
> 
> If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
> 
> To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)
> 
> 
> ###Encourage others to vote!
> 
> Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:
> 
> > Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.

Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

Dealing with such questions in this site, would lead to the following problems, like wrong and unreliable advice.

So, such questions should be migrated to the Law site, IMO.

Stack Exchange works hard for its communities, but there is a limit. If thingiverse changes its API (which it can, and does, do at any time without notice) then anything we build on it has to be modified, and users will be very whiny until it's fixed.

If we choose to integrate model viewing or any sort of API integration with an outside service, we will have to make sure the service provides some sort of legacy guarantee minimal API that won't change, and then we will only be able to use that.  

### Political issues

I would be very uncomfortable endorsing a closed source, commercial service on this site.  There are many communities within the world of 3D printing that are very unhappy with makerbot, thingiverse, and their parent company, and encouraging users to use this service may result in pushing away some very valuable experts within the reprap world.

### Looking to the future

If we integrate any sort of model library or model viewer, I strongly suggest we choose an open source project the community can heartily endorse.  We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.","2"

Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't *think* about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that ""I must solve it this way"" and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. 

That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.

It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is *part of the problem*. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.

Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like ""It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just *happens* to be an alternative"", but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast. Just be open to the fact that if the alternative *does* work for other people, it's going to remain acceptable on the site.","2"

First, overlap between sites is fine. *It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else*; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.

I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)
> I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.

Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.

We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.

That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet.","2"

Absolutely. We need to reward good answers, and raise rep levels so suers can get moderation privileges when they rise to the normal public beta levels.

However, I think we should also downvote poor questions and answers. I haven't yet done so, partly because I've focused on rewarding the good posts. But downvoting is important, too.

What happened to me yesterday:

 1. I posted an answer (my first) to a question.
 2. It was downvoted.
 3. A user who may/may not have been the downvoter pointed out something I was wrong about.
 4. There was a discussion in comments.
 5. I deleted my answer.
 6. I edited it.
 7. There was continued dialogue with the user and another. I improved my answer even further.
 8. Downvote was removed.

I'm grateful to the downvoter, and to the comments. We need to establish what posts are good and bad in the site, and my original answer was not good. It was wrong in several points - and since the question was about [tag:safety], it was even more important for it to be correct. The feedback helped me to fix my answer, but if I had not done so, the downvote would have ensured that better answers went to the top.

We should definitely upvote. But downvoting is good, too. Downvoters don't have to comment - that's never the case - but comments certainly help. They helped me.","2"

Here is a *clear* example illustrating the ""tangential issue:""

> I printed a crane mechanism in 3D. How much voltage must I apply to the motor to lift 150 grams?

I see this type of thing all the time. Users will go to the mat arguing that they are printing in 3D, so their question is on topic. It is not. The actual *expertise* needed to answer this question is in electronics. With a question like this, the premise that the user *happens* to be printing in 3D is entirely coincidental to the actual issue. 

The examples you cited above are a bit more iffy. I might argue some of them could (potentially) be on topic&hellip; if the issue of the material being printed in 3D is somehow germane to the problem. I actually don't know enough about the subject to say, so I'm only considering the possibility that it *is* relevant to this subject space.

Let's not be too quick to start barring questions that aren't explicitly about the physical process of 3D printing literally. There are a lot of *industry issues* that could be interesting to include here. It's probably better to ***wait for actual examples before trying to create a general rule around this issue.***

As a general rule for building this site, it is often better to wait for a preponderance of problems that occur *in actual practice* before we start seeking to create a lot of rules around hypothetical situations. Words to live by.","5"

Thats not to say that nothing will change or that we can't refine our thoughts on this but getting a rough draft wouldn't be the worst thing.

Taking the Super User example we could consider at least a few things, something like this for example,

On topic for 3d Printing
-
* Specific issues with a 3d printer (e.g. My 3d printer keeps failing prints)
* Real problems or questions you have (e.g. How do I level my 3d printer)

Off Topic
-
* Anything not related to 3d printing
* Opinion based questions (e.g. Which is the better 3d Printer?)
* Shopping Buying and product recommendations 
* Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer

Things that we need to decide on
-

Legal questions (e.g. Can I 3d print a gun)
Software questions (e.g. questions about blender for making 3.d models specifically to print, on topic or defer to the Blender Stack Exchange site)

This is just a sample off of some things I can think of off the top of my head.

<li>a specific 3d printer design or implementation problem</li>
<li>the theory and simulation of 3d printers</li>
<li>a sensor, actuator or controller for a 3d printer</li>
<li>algorithms or techniques for 3d printing</li>
</ul>

<p>… then you’re in the right place to ask your question!</p>

<p>Some kinds of questions aren't allowed here:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping recommendations</strong>: Questions which ask ""which product or library should I use"" or ""Where can I buy X"", are considered <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">shopping recommendations</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Electronics theory</strong>: Questions which are more general electrical engineering questions and have no real relation to 3d printers are better off at <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Generic programming questions with no relation to 3d printers should be asked on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>

<li><strong>CAD/CAM</strong>: Questions about computer aided design and manufacture should be be asked on <a href=""http://engineering.stackexchange.com"">Engineering</a>, unless they are related to 3d printing, in which they are fine here.</li>

<li><strong>Life Questions</strong>: Questions about choosing how to spend your time (what book to read, which class to take, what 3d printer project to construct, what career to pursue, etc.) may be about difficult decisions, and they are often important, but they are too specific to your own situation and are unlikely to help future visitors to the site. They would be better off asked in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216"">3d Printing Chat</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Generally speaking, if your question is directly related to <em>3d printers</em> then even if your question might <em>also</em> be appropriate on another site, we are likely to be happy to see it here.</p>

<p>Please <a href=""/search"">look around</a> to see if your question has been asked before. It’s also OK to <a href=""/helpcenter/self-answer"">ask and answer your own question</a>.</p>

<p>If your question is not specifically on-topic for $SiteName, it may be on topic for <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"">another Stack Exchange site</a>. If no site currently exists that will accept your question, you may <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq"">commit to</a> or <a href=""http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76974/how-can-i-propose-a-new-site"">propose</a> a new site at <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/"">Area51</a>, the place where new Stack Exchange communities are democratically created.</p>

We need to have at least a rough idea of what is on and off topic to know what the site will be about. Without a least some discussion on this how will mods know when a question needs to be closed? Thats not to say that nothing will change or that we can't refine our thoughts on this but getting a rough draft wouldn't be the worst thing.

Taking the Super User example we could consider at least a few things, something like this for example,

On topic for 3d Printing
-
* Specific issues with a 3d printer (e.g. My 3d printer keeps failing prints)
* Real problems or questions you have (e.g. How do I level my 3d printer)

Off Topic
-
* Anything not related to 3d printing
* Opinion based questions (e.g. Which is the better 3d Printer?)
* Shopping Buying and product recommendations 
* Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer

Things that we need to decide on
-

* Legal questions (e.g. Can I 3d print a gun)
* Software questions (e.g. questions about blender for making 3.d models specifically to print, on topic or defer to the Blender Stack Exchange site)

This is just a sample off of some things I can think of off the top of my head.

I don't see any reason to rule out industrial machines either. With the current user base those questions might go unanswered but there's no reason this site couldn't attract industry experts when it goes public.

But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?

In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with.","2"

We're still currently in the private beta stage, and we'll be in this spot for another 9 days. After nearly two weeks of private beta, it's perfectly natural for activity to slow down.

Don't lose out. Make sure that you keep your commitment to this strong. Keep active on meta, working through the queues and discussing site issues. 

Quantity is not everything. Whatever you do, never sacrifice quality in these critical stages. Don't ask questions simply for the sake of asking: if you do, you're bailing out on the site. Continue answering questions with quality. If you start seeding the site with lower-quality questions, you'll destroy the site. I've seen this happen. You've got a reputation so far, make sure to keep it, or even improve it. ","2"

One of the best ways to advertise ourselves across the entire Stack Exchange network is through community ads. 

### So what are these ""Community Ads?""

Graduated sites allow the community to advertise relevant products or services within the site, using a system where the community chooses what to advertise. You can find these posts on per-site metas. Hint: these posts have the [meta-tag:community-ads] tag!

### Cool! What should the ad be like?

There's a few requirements for these ads. Most notably,

- They must be 300px wide by 250px tall, or double for ""retina"" displays
- There's a limit on file size of 150 kB.
- The image must be hosted on i.stack.imgur (the Stack Exchange image hosting service).
- Ads must be GIF or PNG (no animated GIFs).

### What else should I know?

To facilitate easy posting to other sites, make sure that the embedded image is of the following format:

<pre>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</pre>

You can also include a message as a part of your answer with your own thoughts: why you chose some of the elements, and what sites the ads could potentially be posted to. Don't forget to critique each other as well!

**Happy Designing!**

You last paragraph is a better question, since you here ask *how* to find the right filament for your cause. If that is really what you want to ask, you could try putting more emphasis on that specific question.

If what you actually want to know is what filament you should use for one *specific* application - for instance for a part that need to withstand physical stress - try asking about that instead.

However there is special site dedicated for that: [Hardware Recommendations SE][1] (tag: [3d-printer][2]), so it's actually on-topic there. And similar for software, check for [Software Recommendations][3].

The problem essentially is that this Q&A format isn't suited to very long treatises on this type of subject.  It's far better to ask a specific question such as *""How do I smooth this ABS print to eliminate all signs that it was 3D printed?""* and receive several good answers, than to have a one-stop-wiki question that attempts (and usually does very poorly) at holding all the answers to all the possible smoothing questions.

I've had my eyes in 3D printing since about 2008 when I first heard of the MakerBot Cupkake CNC and delved into the 3D printing realm in 2011 when I bought my first printer (Replicator Dual).

> 
> - Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
> - Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.
> - Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.

> Bonus points for:
>
> - Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).
> - Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.
> - Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.
>
>Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:
>
> - Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.
> - Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).
> - Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.

>Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**

Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:

- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.
- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.
- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.
- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.
- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. 
- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.

As an active [Moderator Pro Tempore][1] over on [Robotics][2], I have a solid grasp of [A Theory of Moderation][3] and 3 years of experience, so know what the job entails. My average flag handling time over the last month has been around 12 hours, I have built up [useful][4] [tools][5] to [help][6] swiftly deal with problems and I try to [involve][7] the [community][8] any [time][9] I'm not sure about how we want to [handle][10] things.

I supported the original [Personal Manufacturing][11] site and felt passionate enough about it to create [Digital Fabrication][12] and take it all the way to private beta. I have also [supported][13] people asking [3d printing questions over on Robotics][14] while getting [this proposal][15] up and running.

I have seen at least one answer so far which included an equation, so might have benefited from having MathJax markup enabled.

It is apparently easy for the Stack Exchange team to enable, we just need to decide whether we want it or not.

See my [MathJax reference post on Robotics meta][2] for some examples of what MathJax can do.

The 3D printing industry is both blessed and cursed in terms of development. While software and general usability is relatively easy compared to traditional manufacturing technologies, the general lack of digital feedback from the machine makes it difficult for the end user.

With this in mind, I find it difficult at this point in time to include 3D printing-related formulas. Most other math-based questions will most likely be [Electrical Engineering][1] related or [Software][2] related which I think is still a grey area here on the 3D printing site.

Someone left a comment below your question stating that your question was related to a [more narrow question][1]. I would recommend editing your question to explain your situation a bit more. Here are some good points that you can provide users to make it easier to answer:

 - Does your print require specific mechanical properties (ie high strength, heat resistance, electrical conductivity, flexibility, etc.)
 - Does your print need to ""look pretty""
 - What type of 3D printing technology are you wishing to use (FDM, FFF, SLS, etc.)

Answering some of these questions will definitely provide users with more direction as to how to answer your question. As it stands right now, your question will result in the general response: ""Well, it depends on what you're trying to make..."".

I'm sure that I'm not the only one here that has a few different types of material available at any given point as result of various projects (ABS, PLA, PVA, TPE, etc.).

(About the size of 1 -2 cubic centimeters) And if so, then if that question would be appropriate to ask in the beta forum? 

The reason I ask is someone asked me if it was able to, but I have not been able to access the actual 3-D printer for use at this time, just manuals which I have looked through.

I have been an active user of various Stack Exchange forums since 2012, but now finally found a forum that I really can contribute to. 



As a robotics engineer by education, I early got interested in the art of 3D printing, and decided to join the community for myself in 2014 when I graduated from university. Over the past two years I have experimented with my trustworthy Kossel Mini printer to the point where I now need to set new challenges to still have something to do. Being a part of this community has provided me further challenges and learning potential, which I truly appreciate.

I already spend a lot of time on this forum, and try to help new users, answer questions and finish the review queues whenever possible. Overall, I am very proud of the how this site has turned out so far, and would very much like to help it progress further.

So far, my highest reputation is held in this 3D Printing community. I've relied on the Stack Exchange network since about 2011, didn't become a member of Stack Overflow until last year. In my time on this community, I've maintained a reputation position within the top 10%, tried keeping up with the few reviews we've had thus far, and tried updating the tag definitions.

I've had my eyes in 3D printing since about 2008 when I first heard of the MakerBot Cupkake CNC and delved into the 3D printing realm in 2011 when I bought my first printer (Replicator Dual). I've learned a great deal through trial and error and am excited to help others who may be just starting in 3D printing.

As this site continues to attract more members, I've enjoyed seeing new posts and trying to help direct proper questions/answers based on the general consensus I've seen here on Meta. Although I'm not extremely involved in Meta, I do try to keep up on what's being said.","5"

On a site such as SO, these are the kind of questions that ends up ""staying"", getting a high view counts and the great answers. There are, however, also a large amount of *new* questions on SO that never meet those standards, but rather face the same kind of problems that we see here.

I believe the issue for most new users - here and on SO - is that *in order to ask a good question, you more or less already need to know the answer*, or at least the format of the answer. And with 3D printing being such a novel technology for most users, they simply do not have the required experience to ask the ""correct"" question at their first attempt.

Perhaps our job should lean more towards *helping users to find out what they really should be asking about*, rather than simply voting down or closing the question right away because it does not uphold our desired standard. As for how to accomplish that, I think the points mentioned by @tbm0115 could be a good starting point.

On Robotics, one of my [Copy-pastable comment text for common problems with questions?][1] is:

>### Questions by new users for closed for other reasons
`Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that questions like this really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*. Take a look at [ask] and [about] for more information on how stack exchange works. Also, the [*Robotics* question checklist](http://meta.robotics.stackexchange.com/q/1302/37) has good advice on how to write a good question. If you edit your question to fit our community guidelines we can reopen it for you.`

Closure is intended to **temporarily** stop people answering questions which can't be easily answered in their present form, **while the question is being improved**. As such, I disagree with [tbm0115's suggestion][2] that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.

Instead, I offer the following suggestion:

* If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the *rejection*.

If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.

Finally, don't forget the importance of [broken windows theory][3].

The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.

So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.

Currently, (03/28/2016), we do not have any moderators to make these tasks easier to manage.

If the synonym suggestion is not accepted, then external searches may be hindered to only display results for the term *heated-bed* as opposed to *heated-bed* **or** *hbp*.

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.

#Search Engines#
Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.

So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.

Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:

***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.

***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more ""keywords"" that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.

#Etiquette#
I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to ""advertise"" the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend ""advertising"" the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.

If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.

Therefore, you need to make sure to address a set of key points:

- Is the tag name ambiguous? Will an amateur be able to understand the subject without having to research it? For example, what on earth is [tag:abs]?
- Can the word have multiple meanings? If yes, you need to be specific as to which meaning you want. For example, [tag:health] vs [tag:safety]
- Are their cases when the tag should not be used?
- Likewise, are their cases when the tag should be used?
- Is the existing excerpt empty? Something is usually better than nothing.

In general, excerpts should provide at least some guidance, even if it may appear to be ridiculously basic. Therefore, interpretation of the rejection reason is critical:

> Tag excerpts amounting to, ""[tag] is for questions about [tag]"" are pointless and usually rejected. Excerpts should describe why and when a tag would be used.

That's like saying, *[abs]: For questions about [abs] filaments.* That should probably be rejected.

This is better: *[abs]: For questions about [abs] filaments - filaments that are used with blah blah printers, and are not toxic for use.*

Or even better: *[abs]: For questions about [abs] filaments - filaments that are used with blah blah printers, and are not toxic for use. Not to be confused with [pla] filaments. Do not use this tag if your question does not concern this filament specifically.*

Obviously, I have no idea if abs is even a thing. Anyways, I hope this helps :)","2"

One could argue that such questions are hard to answer, and most likely outside the knowledge of most users, but I still think *good* bio questions should be encouraged. 

As for the linked question specifically, I think it is way too broad, asking not one, but perhaps five completely fine questions at the same time. Individually, I believe those questions would be answerable to the right person.

I wonder whether it's on-topic asking how to repair 3D printers. In my case I'd describe what does not work, what the result is and what parts are used.

From a good answer I'd expect a proposal on how to fix it, e.g. a suggestion for an electronic piece to buy (like a photo sensor maybe) and how to apply the wiring etc.

An example format might be: 

#How do I repair {X}#

> I've tried {a[]} to fix {X}, but {b[]} occurred. What are some other common means of fixing {X}?

Most of what is acceptable on SE is troubleshooting and I feel that repairing is a subset of troubleshooting. In other words, typically you'll result in repairing from troubleshooting, but [hopefully] not the other way around. So, a repair question is essentially requiring, upfront, what a great quality answer would provide in some troubleshooting questions.

For example:

#{X} wont work#
> {X} isn't working, what could be the cause?

could lead to:

> I've encountered {X} as a result of {Y}. I was able to fix it by performing {C}.

Where **{C}** is typically going above and beyond the OP's question.

It has... been some time since the site has begun. Normally, pro tem selection process is done very early in the site lifecycle (read: second week). However, in a mix of a mess largely centered around myself, the selection process not only took a while to get off foot, but also took a long time to complete.

All that is done now! I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed.

I think we either need to:

* Change the acceptable scope of questions to be asked
* Change how we welcome new users

Right now most new users do not ask questions ""the SE way"", which quickly leads to down-votes and closing votes. For new users this is a direct slap in the face.

What we rather should do is to *encourage* new users to improve their question, and if they do, give them the highly desired up-votes to make them come back for more.

 - **10 positive votes**, passes.
 - **One answer per topic**. The focus is voting on topics, and votes pertain to the validity of the topic.
 - Similar topics that can be merged should explicitly mention the deprecated topic.
 - Appropriately passed topics should have closed questions re-opened (as appropriate).

More specifically, question relating to **electronics**, **mechanics** and **control theory** which is *set in a 3D printing context*.

**Why include:**

There are multiple questions about 3D printing that also could be asked in the electrical and mechanical engineering sites, as well as the robotics site. However, since most 3D printers basically are desktop robots, all of these topics will eventually be relevant. 

Examples: [one][1] and [two][2].

**Why exclude:**

In some cases, questions within these topics might simply receive much *better* answers by people at the other sites, such as [this seemingly simple question][3].

I need to bridge the chasm of knowledge between my current design and limited knowledge to a fleshed-out design file with chosen materials and other specifics.

If you post a question that is closed, it would acceptable to post a question here on Meta that specifically asks how to make your question fit within the scope of the site.

I would suggest providing as much information as you have and feel free to ask the more general questions about 3D printing.

However, your question is important to address here.

Ultimately, you shouldn't be afraid to go ahead and ask the question. If the question does not meet the conditions of the present site, the general public will be sure to let you know and (hopefully) help direct you in at least asking a more direct question.

If you post a question that is closed, it would acceptable to post a question here on Meta that specifically asks how to make your question fit within the scope of the site.

I would suggest providing as much information as you have and feel free to ask the more general questions about 3D printing. Most people in the community will ask specific questions to try and help you. Some may even be able to fill in the blanks of what you're asking and provide you with very helpful answers.

I suggest we close question of the latter format as ""Unclear what you're asking"". What settings you should use depends on much more than just the printer and material. An answer to the question of the former format would also be useful to a much wider audience (since it deals with a well-defined problem and fix for that problem), while an answer to the latter format is only useful for people using that specific printer and material.","2"

I do agree with Robert Cartaino when he said:
'_The folks here will work hard to curate this collection of knowledge(...)_'

It's true that SE forums are so valuable also because there are hard working moderators and editors - no doubt.

I also agree with this (but with some objections):
'_(...) when someone finally finds this site through search, the last thing we want to do is send them elsewhere to find that information_'

Being strict, according to this part, linking is not allowed... which is not true isn't it?. I didn't link poor websites or other forums or any information from ""somewhere"" / ""elsewhere"". I did link ""the sources"", pages which are the real sources of the knowledg in the case of asked question. And because these sources are quite big and stable, it's high prpbablility that there were available for long time (till the question and answer will have any meaning) and they will be the most accurate and up to date as possible.

So the question is, should I rewrite such sources just because answer based on links is not allowed or maybe it's better to be not such strict.

Please consider and express what you think about such situations.

ps: I admit my answer could be comment insted of answer and if there will be such will of mods I'll rewrite it as comment as I wanted to help this user (and I think he upvoted which means he gathered the knowledge he asked for).

Here is the actual guidance that went with the removal of that post:

> Thank you for answering, unfortunately links sending users elsewhere to find that information aren't really considered an ""answer"" in the context of this site. The folks here will work hard to curate this collection of knowledge, so when someone finally finds this site through search, the last thing we want to do is send them *elsewhere* to find that information. If you don't think the question is worth answering here, you can always vote to close, but I have to remove this as ""not an answer"" in the context of this site.

The *quality* of the link you provided is not in question. The problem is that Stack Exchange isn't meant to be a search engine or a list of links. We have Google for that. 

Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, **we have a responsibility *not* to purport having information we do not.** 

> sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all

That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that *one* person in the minimal possible sense&hellip; but for the hundreds (sometimes *thousands*) of people who come after, all we did was create yet **another barrier** between the user and the information they were searching for.

That does not make the Internet better.

Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a *proper* answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites ""work"", so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue *resolved.* Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then *everyone* can do it. 

And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content. And comments sit very prominently right there below the question, so they appear before even the *best* answers which are supposed to rise to the top. ","2"

 - There is the [Don't Ask][1] page and the [On-Topic][2] (which we have control over its content).
 - The suggested/related questions that appear when asking a question. Ideally users at least regard its existence before posting the question.
 - There appears to be a pop-up that does try to warn the user that their question is ""subjective"". I tested it really quick, see the image below[![enter image description here][3]][3]
 - All else fails, that's what moderators are for. Moderators should utilize the tools available to them. So even if these types of questions pile up, there are means of quickly identifying. A simple feature, available to everyone, is advanced searches. I try to use searches like [this][4] to quickly identify large groups of questions that may need attention.
  - It might be nice to have more options over whether keywords can be contained or not, ""asker"" reputation, ""answerer"" reputation, etc.

#1.

Often, what we do is you have a canonical ""catch-all"" question.

Since the shopping questions seem to have been deemed off-topic, this is probably your best bet. What you need to do is to guide users to select a printer themselves, but by asking them a set of criteria. Therefore, you would need an answer that addresses the following questions (but in no way limited to the following):

- What filament do I choose?
- What's my budget?
- What size do I need?

... etc. 

With such a post, you guide users to what they want, and then in the end, you can recommend a few printers.

Also, this question has to be locked using what's known as a wiki-lock. This way, the community can edit the question to update it, and it prevents spam and other nonsensical answers.

#2.

You close them as off-topic.

Since this seems to be a persistent problem, it would be helpful to add a custom close reason (hey mods! That's for you!). Something along the lines of this would be good:

> Questions asking for the recommendation of a printer or other 3D printing-related resource are off-topic because they tend to attract opinion-based questions, low-quality answers, and spam. For more information, see [Why are recommendations off-topic and where can I ask?](link to a meta post)

You get the community to get support for the close reason, and a moderator implements it to allow questions to be closed. Bingo!

However, you're going to need a meta post explaining why they are off-topic as well as other information. That's good etiquette: you don't leave users stranded and you continue to guide them to where they can ask a question.

# 3.

You do 1. first.

Then, you allow such ""shopping"" questions to be on-topic, as long as they follow the specific criteria and answer all the questions that you have outlined in the meta post. Otherwise, you close it.

Numerous sites do this. On Open Source, we allow questions that ask for the recommendation of an open source license. We have a meta post on what you need to include, as well as a dedicated close reason in case something is not of quality. It works very well.

The only downside, is that it can take a bit of time and work to get right.","2"

However, I would say that services related to 3D printing should be okay. Please regard [Robert Cartaino's][1] response on potential topics. He brings up a good point:

> *This is one of those times where I'd say it's not the ""name"" that defines this site, but the intentions of the community that built it.*

For the questions in mind, I think that questions related to discovering new ""Makerspace""-type communities and sites would be appropriate. In the case of your software question. I would definitely highlight some key features, if you can, of what you might be looking for. For example:

 - Plug and Play software
 - Customizable G-Code
 - Advanced control over parameters
 - Dual-Extrusion capability
 - Compatibility with a print server
 - etc.

Information like this can make or break a *""What is the best...""* question.

Typically you want to stay away from asking questions about *""What is the best...""*. Instead, try to present your question as more of a *""What is the best... for me?""* type question. As I mentioned in your other question, try to provide more details of what you might need. In the case of 3D printing services, I'll use the example of 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ <sub>(I'm not affiliated at all, just an example)</sub>.

A *""What is best...""* question may be appropriate if the contents of your question contains key characteristics of what you, as an individual, needs out of the service. For example:

> I need a part printed, but I also need this key feature machined and coated. I've looked at 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ, which (at this point) would be able to perform all of these operations for my part?

On the opposite perspective:

> I want to start providing 3D printing services, but I have a CNC router and some other woodworking machines that I'd like to provide services for as well. Which might be better for me, 3D Hubs or MakeXYZ?

In each example, there is more of an emphasis on what you need as an individual. Another user can take the answers with a grain of salt and best apply the answers to their own situation in the end.

1. Support material helps define relevance to a specific material type, ie PLA/ABS, PVA, that lime stuff that MakerBot tried selling, wax, etc.
2. Support structures helps define relevance to the existence of support structure being generated and/or their physical dimensions.

So, I guess you could say that *Support Material* is a *what* question <sub>(as-in *what* is it made of)</sub> and *Support Structure* is a *how* and *why* question <sub>(as-in *how* is it made and *why* is it needed)</sub>.

I'd also like to point out that you said

> I don't think there is the need to have separate tags for support's structure and material, since the material is ***in most cases*** the same as printed.

A large factor in maintaining the quality in a site like SE is adhering to all cases, even if that means having a large number of tags to keep track of.","2"

One could say that 3D reconstruction is a bit sidetracked from typical 3D printing (apart from the 3D part :)), but then again, 3D reconstruction and printing also go hand in hand in some cases, such as with 3D scanners. 

Since 3D reconstruction can be a fairly math heavy topic, and I am unsure as to whether you will get any good answers here (but that depends on the specific question too, of course!). I suggest you simply write the question as best you can, and give it a try here. If it doesn't get any response, try heading over to some other site as well, such as:

* Mathematics SE
* Stack Overflow
* Computer Science SE
* Electrical Engineering SE

The reason I am bringing this up is to try and increase our ""answer accepted"" percentage. Currently <sup>(07/03/2016)</sup> there are 396 questions and using `is:question hasaccepted:no closed:no` there are 162 questions unaccepted, of which only 11 do not have answers. So, basic math tells us that roughly 40% of our questions are unaccpted. According to our [Area51][1] page, we only have 43 users with reputaion higher than 200, we need 107 more users out of the 2,353 users total to reach this goal. Some, if not most of these users currently have a reputation higher than 100 (partially due to the at least 300 reputation on another SE site).

Furthermore, that community add we have been discussing [over here][1], does anyone know how to actually get that going? :-)

In general this probably is pretty regular behavior (seeing my behavior in the reprap forum for example, where I generally only pass to read, not to interact that much). In the phase this SE is in I'd take it as highly beneficial if we could encourage more action in the users (in this thread the most simple one - voting), because missing interaction maybe won't bring users back regularly enough.

However, if the question of ""*How can I change the thermistors settings in Marlin firmware?*"" were to arise, then the question would be best suited here on 3D Printing. It might help both SE sites by providing links to each other's relevant questions for future users to reference.

This also provides the SE network with more appropriate traffic based on the question at hand.

However, if the question of ""*How can I change the thermistors settings in Marlin firmware?*"" were to arise, then the question would be best suited here on 3D Printing. It might help both SE sites by providing links to each other's relevant questions for future users to reference.

**Update**

After reading a few posts on SE meta, [this one](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work) leads me to agree with you that this particular question may not have needed to be migrated. However, it exposes an important question of how we want to proceed with questions like this in the future? How far down the rabbit hole do we want to allow this site to go in this topic? I'd recommend others pitch in recommendations in answers here on what would be the appropriate topic in this case that can be applied to our [On-Topic][1] page so that it may be amended.

We've received a few questions along the lines of purchasing references since we've opened in Beta. While I personally don't think direct questions about ""*What is the best 3D printer to buy?*"" are appropriate questions, I'm curious about a potential middle ground.

Should we consider including tags such as [tag:printer-review], [tag:buyer-review], or [tag:printer-reference]? The idea being that certain questions would inherit one of these tags (or something similar) to help facilitate traffic to specific questions. These questions would pose ideally be (in the OP's eyes) useful in making a purchase decision. 

Case in point:
[This question][1], outlining some of the potential relative cons to UV printing compared to FDM/FFF printing, could prove useful to someone looking into purchasing a new UV printer.

This idea can be combined with those proposed [here][2], such as @TomvanderZanden's suggestion to create a series of controlled ""best"" questions.

I might also suggest that if we, as a community, decide to use such a system have moderators lock these questions to avoid any sort of spam (unnecessary answers). These questions should also be set to ***community wiki*** to ensure that any bias is dealt with as a community.

3D Printing alone makes for a very narrow community if it excludes subtractive manufacturing questions. For example, there is no python.stackexchange.com or javascript.stackexchange.com, all of that goes into one network: stackoverflow.com. That's just the same level of division.

So, for instance, if the software you are asking about is the same as a 3D printer would use, I would agree that it can be asked here. However, if the software is dedicated to CNC machines and unusable for 3D printers, it does not belong here at the time being.

If the software you are looking for indeed works for both 3D printers and CNC machines, then perhaps you could specify this in your question to make it more relevant to this site?","2"

SO is obviously the most general one of these, but there are many more specialized ones (CodeReview,TeX,Programmers,Drupal/Wordpress/Joomla/Server Fault/Ubuntu/...). If this site had been ""Makers StackExchange"" or ""Digital Fabrication"" then your question might have been appropriate (this site being a more general one), but ""3D printing"" should be seen as a more specialized one (but if you think there is a need for a specific Makers SE or a CNC SE, then you could consider going to Area51).

This site is called ""3D printing"" and CNC milling is definitely not 3D printing. I think it does very much make sense to limit 3D printing to ""additive fabrication"". This is not a particularly narrow scope, since there are many types of 3D printer, and not all of them use G-code. Powder printers (binder jetting) and DLP printers are driven with raster images, for instance.

If the scope were extended to cover your question (which is about 2D milling, not even 3D milling, while we're at it) then I wonder if that meant that questions like ""How many flutes do I need on my 8mm ball-nose left-hand bit when cutting unobtainium with my feedrate at the speed of sound?"" would also be in scope. When I hear ""3D printing SE"" I would definitely not expect *that*.

I would add that your question might have been closed on a hypothetical ""CNC SE"" as well for a variety of reasons:

 - Opinion based/list question

 - Very little own effort

 - Too broad (need to be more specific)","2"

 - [What is the best 3D modeling software for a beginner on a 3D printed mini barrel project?](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2665/what-is-the-best-3d-modeling-software-for-a-beginner-on-a-3d-printed-mini-barrel)

 - [What is a good software for designing car parts](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2697/what-is-a-good-software-for-designing-car-parts)

On almost any Stack Exchange (barring [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/)) this type of question would be shot down immediately, as they are quite problematic:

 - Too broad: a very large range of software packages can be used to do almost anything. Without sufficient details in the question, it's impossible to narrow down an answer to a few software packages.

 - Primarily Opinion Based: the best software package is generally the one you're most proficient with. As such, people are likely to recommend packages based on what they're already familiar with, rather than what is truly the ""best"" choice.

[This meta post](http://meta.softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information) on software recommendations lays down some guidelines on what constitutes a ""good"" software recommendation. Basically, a question should identify precise requirements, in order of importance, that the software should have. I think neither of the example questions achieve this, since they basically boil down to ""I want to model an X"" but give no indication of what features they need from the software, what operating system it should run on, what their budget is,...

 - Are the current questions acceptable?

 - Should we adopt SR's guidelines?

 - Should we disallow ""recommendation""-questions altogether?","2"

I think that there very seldom are any *good* questions that ask for printer or software recommendations, and I would therefore vote for them not being allowed in general. 

So far I have handled these types of questions by waiting to see if other users flag them, and then take action after a close vote has been made. If we decide they should be avoided in general, we probably want to put them on hold right away - this would also make the answers much more consistent after eventual edits.

UPDATE:

Another recommendation [question][1] was asked today. The OP wants to buy a 3D printer that can be used for printing dental implants. I believe this question has two possible types of answers:

1. **Highly subjective:** ""Printers made by MkrBot are much better than PtrBot, get the first (...)""
2. **Informational objective:** ""Get a resin based printer because they typically have better resolution than FDM printers (...)""

While the first is almost entirely opinion based, the second can offer some proper insight that will help the OP in search for a specific printer. In these cases, I suggest that we try to guide the OP into formulating their question such that they promote answers of the the second type, rather than the first.

However, this raises the question why are there both? [heated-bed][1] has a short but sensible definition, whereas [heatbed][2] has no tag definition, so it is unclear the intended difference, if any, in their use. 

After a quick search of Meta to see if this issue has already been raised, I, now, see that there is also the tag [hbp][3], see http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/115/merge-hbp-and-heated-bed-tags.

For completeness, the respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:

 - [tag:heatbed] 5
 - [tag:heated-bed] 34
 - [tag:hbp] 11

So these are my questions:

 - Should these tags be merged/deleted or left as is? It seems a little confusing, as it stands currently. 
 - Should I add the [tag:hbp] to my question? 
 - Should I remove the [tag:heatbed] tag? 
 - Should I, also, have created a [tag:heated-bed-support], or [tag:heatbed-support] tag?

However, this raises the question why are there both? [heated-bed][1] has a short but sensible definition, whereas [heatbed][2] has no tag definition, so it is unclear the intended difference, if any, in their use. 

After a quick search of Meta to see if this issue has already been raised, I, now, see that there is also the tag [hbp][3], see http://meta.3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/115/merge-hbp-and-heated-bed-tags.

For completeness, the respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:

 - [tag:heatbed] 5
 - [tag:heated-bed] 34
 - [tag:hbp] 11

So these are my questions:

 - Should these tags be merged/deleted or left as is? It seems a little confusing, as it stands currently. 
 - Which is the preferred term, *heatbed*, or *heated bed*? 
 - Should I add the [tag:hbp] to my question? 
 - Should I remove the [tag:heatbed] tag from my question?
 - With respect to my particular question, should I, also, have created a [tag:heated-bed-support], or a [tag:heatbed-support] tag, or even a [tag:hbp-support] tag, so that it is more appropriately tagged?

If we want to participate, the hats will find our heads too without further action. If we for whatever reason *don't* want to participate, we can choose to opt out. 

What do you guys think? Do we want the hats of 2016 here on 3D Printing SE? :-)

---------------

Here is parts of **the mail** that was sent to the moderator team of 3D Printing SE:

> Most of you remember previous years’ events, but here is a quick little reminder. Winter Bash is an annual event that can run on any Stack Exchange site that chooses to participate. Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:

> [![hats][2]][2]

> As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!

> **The Details**

> The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event. 

> Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage. 

> The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.

So... let me start like this..

[THIS IS REALLY DEVASTATING][1]

We all need to vote up users and try to answer their questions, so we can get more users answering / asking questions. Main reason I'm writing this post is because this is great site, but we need new regular users that are going to vote and ask questions. I think it all came down to 20-30 active users, and rest of users aren't so active.

I'm relatively new to site. I've decided to use it because it helped me a lot, and I'm doing my best to answer the questions. My main concern is also that my answers also don't get any vote up.

So... I'll let it all out. I think that main concern that we need to focus on is motivation.

WE NEED TO MOTIVATE OTHERS TO VOTE. And we all can do that if we vote other users up.

That's from my perspective. Even one vote up motivates you to go further.

If you are answering (in my case now for example) 6 questions in row without any vote up, it's really demotivating. But it's me. I'll answer again and again. But there are users that'll answer 10 questions for example and get only one vote up, and they are simply going to stop answering.

I think that I explained what I mean. :) It's all in VOTE UP!

We have now been in public Beta for almost a year now and I feel that we've learned a lot about what audience we have here on Stack Exchange. However, we've got a little ways to go before we can make it out of Beta.

#The Stats#

 - *Questions per day* is **2.1**/10; 21% of the way there
 - Our *answer rate* is still good with **96%**
 - We need to work on our votes
  - We have **56**/150 users with *200+ reputation*
  - We have **4**/10 users with *2,000+ reputation*
  - We have **3**/5 users with *3,000+ reputation*
 - Our *answers per question* ratio is **2.0**/2.5. which is good, but could be better
 - We currently hold an average of **753** *visits per day* out of a recommended 1,500 per day.

All of these stats are live and always available on [our Area51 site][1].

##Let's increase our Visits!##
Ultimately, the kink in the chain is that we do not have enough visitors. The more visitors we accrue, the easier it may become to reach some of these smaller goals such as ***questions per day*** and ***user reputation***. Remember that the home page for 3D Printing has sharing links to social media sites.

There are a growing number of 3D printing sites such as Thingiverse, 3D Hubs, MakeXYZ, Shapeways, etc. All of these sites have avid users and I'm sure many of them have questions on a regular basis and are more than happy to share their knowledge with other Makers/Professionals.

##Let's increase our Votes!##
The more people we have visiting the site, the more **opportunity** we have have gaining more reputation.

As Josip Ivic states in a recent [Meta post][2], asking/answering questions becomes a chore if people don't feel that they're efforts are appreciated or good enough. Often times there is legitimate research going into answering certain questions, so there can be real work going into providing people with quality answers.

The same goes for asking questions. If you've been in the same predicament or appreciate a well written question, give the question an up-vote.

##Meta Activity##
I think it is also important for everyone to occasionally review the latest here on Meta. It's a great tool for people to express how they feel the site could be better!

I'm sorry you can feel discouraged sometimes, I think a lot of users around the Stack Exchange network can feel that way at times.

I think people sometimes forget that an up-vote to an answer isn't necessarily that it was helpful to you, specifically. But, rather that **the answer is a good *quality* answer** and **will be *useful* to others** as well!

Most of my questions/answers have received votes, whereas on other (nameless) sites, I have posted a number of questions/answers and not received [m]any votes at all. However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.

While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) *awesome* answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can *sometimes* end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.

I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. 

Regardless, I would agree that voting *does* act as an incentive to contribute to the site, as well as the idea that voting for a good question, or accurate answer, even if that question/answer does not apply directly to you, because it will help other users. Indeed the latter is the entire premise of Stack Exchange.","2"

In my opinion we need to educate the user, nicely. Also we need to remove the question with flagging. Hopefully without offending the person and thus scaring them away from the community.. Maybe just flag as duplicate, etc. Unfortunately this will one of those situations where we cannot perfectly solve.

Which really are CAD / Mech engineering questions. I will note this person needed several rewrites of his question. Though I am not sure asking for Hollywood 007 scifi computer automagic is focused enough for the group... we can ignore that bit... But it is clear after a few revisions that he is looking for cad help.

Where do you all think we draw the line? As CAD is very closely coupled with 3d. I could see questions such as ""how to I render this so it prints well"" as a valid question. I am not sure asking for CAD auto processing software really should be topics we tackle. Or do we want to be inclusive to most non specific CAD questions, and let the members who are strong in that area handle it?

Furthermore, I believe many users get introduced to CAD through 3D printing, which again could make 3D Printing SE a natural place to turn back to.

In my opinion, I think we should allow these types of questions - at least for now. I don't see them as a problem due to their low frequency, and I think we generally manages to produce sensible answers. 

There is also issue that there currently are no other Stack Exchange sites that focus on general CAD. There is always [Blender SE](http://blender.stackexchange.com/), but it would again be somewhat off topic there as well. Perhaps we could find some relevant beta site to direct pure CAD questions to?

I am thinking that we could use a solid message like that, outlining exactly what they need to do, without is having to write it out every time. It is not shown in the copy (hence the link) but there are links in that message.

Thoughts? How can we make this happen?

I don't yet own a printer, and I have never sent anything out to get printed before. I am interested in feedback about the following for example: 

1. Are any features I have included too big/small/angled/etc. to print reliably?
2. Have I set up my components correctly for optimal printing?
3. Are there any obvious structural issues (weak spots, press-fit issues, etc.)
4. Are there any obvious material/time saving things I should consider?
5. What materials are suitable/best for printing my model?
6. What questions should I ask the supplier before comitting?
7. Any other tips on getting my specific model to succeed.

Since Stack Exchange sites are generally **not** for ""primarily opinion based"" questions, I'm not sure if this site itself is a suitable location. 

## Is the 3D Printing Stack Exchange site a suitable place to get feedback on a specific model before printing?

If not is there a Stack Exchange site similar to [Code Review][1], but for reviewing 3D models?

### Update

I have not determined where to print the model b/c it likely depends on some of the answers (ex: printing technology, material, etc.) so I don't have someone I can work with directly yet. Also, I'd rather not choose the supplier as my first step b/c they will likely be biased towards whatever they can supply.

We have maintained a great answer rate here on 3D Printing SE with a answer rate of 96%. I believe this rate has been maintained since day one and it's hard to keep up, especially with fluctuations in user activity.

However, I would like to at least address an issue I've seen trending. Most of the issue comes from old posts and new, unfamiliar users to the SE network. Anyways, there is an abnormally high number of unaccepted answers.

Specifically, in this moment in time (01/28/2017 9am Pacific US) there are **658 questions** ***with answers***, ***258*** of which have **no answer accepted**. This is ***answer acceptance rate of about 40%***.

----------

Now, I've done this in the past with little payout, but perhaps if we have more eyes on it moving forward. I have gone through the list of questions [here](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano+answers%3A1) and commented on the question to ask the OP if any of the answers helped solve their situation. Something like this:

> Hello @[UserName], I noticed your question has been up for a while now. Have any of the answers below been able to solve your question? If so, would you mind accepting the appropriate answer. If not, what is missing so that we may help you further? Also, if you have figured it out on your own, you can always answer and accept your own solution. Thank you.

This should hopefully ping the user. Also, going through these questions may bring up questions that may need moderator attention/intervention.

Hopefully we can tackle this issue and get some other users more reputation in the process.","2"

The question would be of little value to the site as a whole, as nobody else will ever have the same question and so the answers will be useful only to you.

You should instead ask a question (or multiple questions) about a specific aspect you're unsure about, for instance whether a 1mm wall is thick enough to be printed with SLS, or whether a 35 degree overhang angle will print without supports, etc... This helps build a useful archive of questions, because people will be able to search for your question using general terms, rather than trying to find a question about ""Model X"".","2"

Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.**


This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) [post on meta.hermeneutics.SE](https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49); I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.

> I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
> 
> 
> ###Vote on Questions
> Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
> 
> If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
> 
Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)
> 
> ###Vote on Answers
> Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
> 
> *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*
> 
> To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).
> 
If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!
> 
> If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.
> 
> ###Final thoughts
> 
> If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
> 
> To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)
> 
> 
> ###Encourage others to vote!
> 
> Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:
> 
> > Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.

Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

> About a week into the public beta, we will seek out members who are deeply engaged in the community’s development; members who:

> - Have a reasonably high reputation score to indicate active, consistent participation.
> - Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.
> - Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.

>Essentially, **they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!**

Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:

- Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.
- Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.
- If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.
- If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.
- The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. 
- Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read [*A Theory of Moderation*][2] thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.

If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into [chat room][3] where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called [The Assembly](http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly) was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.

Once again, **please don't hesitate to step up and self-nominate!**.

<li><strong>Electronics theory</strong>: Questions which are more general electrical engineering questions and have no real relation to 3d printers are better off at <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Generic programming questions with no relation to 3d printers should be asked on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Life Questions</strong>: Questions about choosing how to spend your time (what book to read, which class to take, what 3d printer project to construct, what career to pursue, etc.) may be about difficult decisions, and they are often important, but they are too specific to your own situation and are unlikely to help future visitors to the site.

Over on _Robotics_ we find that troubleshooting questions can often lead to interesting and often more generalised answers, and can lead to further, more specific questions. These types of questions also tend to be the kind which are difficult to answer through a google search, as not knowing what to search for is a big part of the problem.

Sadly this kind of question is often a new users first question, poorly written and difficult to answer in it's original form, so we tend to close these as _Unclear what you are asking_ and clarify that with the [following comment][2]:

`Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that it is not clear what you are asking. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*, so it is a good idea to include details of what what you would like to achieve, what you have tried, what you expected to see and what you actually saw. Take a look at [ask] and [about] for more information on how stack exchange works. If you edit your question to make it more clear, flag it for moderator attention and we can reopen it for you.`

<sup>The point of leaving this unrendered is so that you can easily copy the raw text to paste into a comment.</sup>

Note that Comments render slightly differently to answers, for instance `[chat]` renders as [3D Printing Chat][3] in a comment but as [chat] in a question or answer.

I have seen at least one answer so far which included an equation, so might have benefited from having MathJax markup enabled.

It is apparently easy for the Stack Exchange team to enable, we just need to decide whether we want it or not.

See my [MathJax reference post on Robotics meta][2] for some examples of what MathJax can do.

On *Robotics* I have the following [canned response](https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/177/37) for shopping questions, and I would highly recommend adapting it for 3dprinting:

`Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that *[shopping questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/)* really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site.

On Robotics, one of my [Copy-pastable comment text for common problems with questions?][1] is:

>### Questions by new users for closed for other reasons
`Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that questions like this really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*.

Also, the [*Robotics* question checklist](https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1302/37) has good advice on how to write a good question. If you edit your question to fit our community guidelines we can reopen it for you.`

Closure is intended to **temporarily** stop people answering questions which can't be easily answered in their present form, **while the question is being improved**. As such, I disagree with [tbm0115's suggestion][2] that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.

Instead, I offer the following suggestion:

* If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the *rejection*.

If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.

Finally, don't forget the importance of [broken windows theory][3].

The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.

So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.

 - [What is the best 3D modeling software for a beginner on a 3D printed mini barrel project?](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2665/what-is-the-best-3d-modeling-software-for-a-beginner-on-a-3d-printed-mini-barrel)

 - [What is a good software for designing car parts](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2697/what-is-a-good-software-for-designing-car-parts)

On almost any Stack Exchange (barring [Software Recommendations](http://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/)) this type of question would be shot down immediately, as they are quite problematic:

 - Too broad: a very large range of software packages can be used to do almost anything. Without sufficient details in the question, it's impossible to narrow down an answer to a few software packages.

 - Primarily Opinion Based: the best software package is generally the one you're most proficient with. As such, people are likely to recommend packages based on what they're already familiar with, rather than what is truly the ""best"" choice.

[This meta post](https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information) on software recommendations lays down some guidelines on what constitutes a ""good"" software recommendation. Basically, a question should identify precise requirements, in order of importance, that the software should have. I think neither of the example questions achieve this, since they basically boil down to ""I want to model an X"" but give no indication of what features they need from the software, what operating system it should run on, what their budget is,...

 - Are the current questions acceptable?

 - Should we adopt SR's guidelines?

 - Should we disallow ""recommendation""-questions altogether?","5"

Over on _Robotics_ we find that troubleshooting questions can often lead to interesting and often more generalised answers, and can lead to further, more specific questions. These types of questions also tend to be the kind which are difficult to answer through a google search, as not knowing what to search for is a big part of the problem.

Sadly this kind of question is often a new users first question, poorly written and difficult to answer in it's original form, so we tend to close these as _Unclear what you are asking_ and clarify that with the [following comment][2]:

`Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that it is not clear what you are asking. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*, so it is a good idea to include details of what what you would like to achieve, what you have tried, what you expected to see and what you actually saw.

I'd be willing to go ahead and add various slicing engines, manufacturers, models, etc. if there was a way to create tags outside of creating questions. It might also be nice to have a cleaner way to edit tag information such as an editable table (instead of pagination).

From what I've noticed (and I just went back through my own voting history), there have been a number of ""primarily opinion based"" and ""too broad"" questions. I believe it's important to maintain quality questions/answers especially in this early stage of release. Please regard [this other meta post][1] asking what the guidelines are for proper 3D Printing community questions.

I, for one, feel that I learned the most SE etiquette by reading a large number of questions on SO as opposed to the SE documentation. It seems that a few of the questions we've gotten lately have been from completely new users to the Stack Exchange network. I don't like scaring people away from the site, so it is best to try and coach these new users.

I retract the following suggestion as I agree with [Mark Booth's answer][2] given his explanation.

<s>I would suggest an informal guideline for closing questions:

 - First, notify the OP to the condition of their question. Perhaps even suggest a means to fix the errant condition(s).
 - If, after at least 24 hours of the comment, the OP has not either responded reasonably (within SE etiquette) nor updated the question, then begin the process of closing.</s>

To me, it seems that most [closed][1] grey-area questions seem to be related to materials. So, questions that may be considered *too broad* as a general materials question may be a viable question for a newbie to the 3D printing world. A new comer may not be familiar with various material types (ie. PLA<sup>[filament]</sup>, ABS<sup>[filament]</sup>, Stainless Steel<sup>[powder]</sup>, Bronze<sup>[powder]</sup>, etc.).

Focusing on material questions may be a good start to the concern. While it may be technically *too broad* asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object. So, if a user specifies (or hints) the preferred printing method (FDM/FFF, SLA, etc.) then I think we should let people use their better judgment in answering the question.


Would it be appropriate to consider re-opening closed questions with the before mentioned criteria?

For the questions in mind, I think that questions related to discovering new ""Makerspace""-type communities and sites would be appropriate. In the case of your software question. I would definitely highlight some key features, if you can, of what you might be looking for. For example:

 - Plug and Play software
 - Customizable G-Code
 - Advanced control over parameters
 - Dual-Extrusion capability
 - Compatibility with a print server
 - etc.

Information like this can make or break a *""What is the best...""* question.

Typically you want to stay away from asking questions about *""What is the best...""*. Instead, try to present your question as more of a *""What is the best... for me?""* type question. As I mentioned in your other question, try to provide more details of what you might need. In the case of 3D printing services, I'll use the example of 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ <sub>(I'm not affiliated at all, just an example)</sub>.

A *""What is best...""* question may be appropriate if the contents of your question contains key characteristics of what you, as an individual, needs out of the service. For example:

> I need a part printed, but I also need this key feature machined and coated. I've looked at 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ, which (at this point) would be able to perform all of these operations for my part?

On the opposite perspective:

> I want to start providing 3D printing services, but I have a CNC router and some other woodworking machines that I'd like to provide services for as well. Which might be better for me, 3D Hubs or MakeXYZ?

In each example, there is more of an emphasis on what you need as an individual. Another user can take the answers with a grain of salt and best apply the answers to their own situation in the end.

In addition, I think we could shed some light onto the other beta goals as well. What do you think about more actively giving good quality questions and answers +1? I believe increasing the overall reputation will encourage users to come back, while also helping us reach our beta goals. 

Furthermore, that community add we have been discussing [over here][1], does anyone know how to actually get that going? :-)

I know this post https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-often, and I do take it to be still the general guideline on how to vote on 3DP:SE.

I personally do like to vote what I'd call slightly more liberal than conservative and I do have the feeling that this is not the way it is usually handled by other users (as can probably be seen by the fact that only two people on 3DP:SE acquired the civic duty badge).

Also, if I look at the questions from the beginning time of the beta, there were much more votes in general. (This of course might be related to many things as 'more substantial questions and answers', more regular users and time that has passed since the question exists, allowing for more views and hence votes).

If a new question already has 40 views, however, I would expect more than 2 votes on the question. It means that 38 views happened in short time, this is, mainly views by 3DP:SE regulars, not search engine referrals (I strongly asumme this point, I do not have any hard evidence), which did look at the topic but have not been touched by the topic enough to vote up, down, or comment.

In general this probably is pretty regular behavior (seeing my behavior in the reprap forum for example, where I generally only pass to read, not to interact that much). In the phase this SE is in I'd take it as highly beneficial if we could encourage more action in the users (in this thread the most simple one - voting), because missing interaction maybe won't bring users back regularly enough.

Are there any ideas how to get the 'https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-often' policy across to new users?
(And if applies: do I take a wrong approach - are there enough votes?)","5"

We've received a few questions along the lines of purchasing references since we've opened in Beta. While I personally don't think direct questions about ""*What is the best 3D printer to buy?*"" are appropriate questions, I'm curious about a potential middle ground.

Should we consider including tags such as [tag:printer-review], [tag:buyer-review], or [tag:printer-reference]? The idea being that certain questions would inherit one of these tags (or something similar) to help facilitate traffic to specific questions. These questions would pose ideally be (in the OP's eyes) useful in making a purchase decision. 

Case in point:
[This question][1], outlining some of the potential relative cons to UV printing compared to FDM/FFF printing, could prove useful to someone looking into purchasing a new UV printer.

This idea can be combined with those proposed [here][2], such as @TomvanderZanden's suggestion to create a series of controlled ""best"" questions.

**Amendment**

I might also suggest that if we, as a community, decide to use such a system have moderators lock these questions to avoid any sort of spam (unnecessary answers). These questions should also be set to ***community wiki*** to ensure that any bias is dealt with as a community.

So, for instance, if the software you are asking about is the same as a 3D printer would use, I would agree that it can be asked here. However, if the software is dedicated to CNC machines and unusable for 3D printers, it does not belong here at the time being.

If the software you are looking for indeed works for both 3D printers and CNC machines, then perhaps you could specify this in your question to make it more relevant to this site?","5"

However, this raises the question why are there both? [heated-bed][1] has a short but sensible definition, whereas [heatbed][2] has no tag definition, so it is unclear the intended difference, if any, in their use. 

After a quick search of Meta to see if this issue has already been raised, I, now, see that there is also the tag [hbp][3], see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115/merge-hbp-and-heated-bed-tags.

For completeness, the respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:

 - [tag:heatbed] 5
 - [tag:heated-bed] 34
 - [tag:hbp] 11

So these are my questions:

 - Should these tags be merged/deleted or left as is? It seems a little confusing, as it stands currently. 
 - Which is the preferred term, *heatbed*, or *heated bed*? 
 - Should I add the [tag:hbp] to my question? 
 - Should I remove the [tag:heatbed] tag from my question?
 - With respect to my particular question, should I, also, have created a [tag:heated-bed-support], or a [tag:heatbed-support] tag, or even a [tag:hbp-support] tag, so that it is more appropriately tagged?

We have now been in public Beta for almost a year now and I feel that we've learned a lot about what audience we have here on Stack Exchange. However, we've got a little ways to go before we can make it out of Beta.

#The Stats#

 - *Questions per day* is **2.1**/10; 21% of the way there
 - Our *answer rate* is still good with **96%**
 - We need to work on our votes
  - We have **56**/150 users with *200+ reputation*
  - We have **4**/10 users with *2,000+ reputation*
  - We have **3**/5 users with *3,000+ reputation*
 - Our *answers per question* ratio is **2.0**/2.5. which is good, but could be better
 - We currently hold an average of **753** *visits per day* out of a recommended 1,500 per day.

All of these stats are live and always available on [our Area51 site][1].

##Let's increase our Visits!##
Ultimately, the kink in the chain is that we do not have enough visitors. The more visitors we accrue, the easier it may become to reach some of these smaller goals such as ***questions per day*** and ***user reputation***. Remember that the home page for 3D Printing has sharing links to social media sites.

There are a growing number of 3D printing sites such as Thingiverse, 3D Hubs, MakeXYZ, Shapeways, etc. All of these sites have avid users and I'm sure many of them have questions on a regular basis and are more than happy to share their knowledge with other Makers/Professionals.

##Let's increase our Votes!##
The more people we have visiting the site, the more **opportunity** we have have gaining more reputation.

As Josip Ivic states in a recent [Meta post][2], asking/answering questions becomes a chore if people don't feel that they're efforts are appreciated or good enough. Often times there is legitimate research going into answering certain questions, so there can be real work going into providing people with quality answers.

The same goes for asking questions. If you've been in the same predicament or appreciate a well written question, give the question an up-vote.

##Meta Activity##
I think it is also important for everyone to occasionally review the latest here on Meta. It's a great tool for people to express how they feel the site could be better!

However I don't think they are quite within the scope of the main site. 

Specific questions regarding the benefits of one style of printer over another would be well suited to the site simply because they're less opinion based than than what a 'review' tag would tend to suggest. 

The question you've posted as a reference, I would say is well suited to the SE since it's asking specific and quantifiable questions with potentially correct or incorrect answers. I think any question posed that could fit under a tag of ""printer-review"" would tend to be more opinion based regardless of how the question is phrased.

----------

## What should our documentation contain?

Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from [the Definition phase of Area 51][2].

But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.

Take the [Super User ""About"" page][3] as an example:

>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.

>Ask about...

> * Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking
> * Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered

>Don't ask about...

> * Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware
> * Questions that are primarily opinion-based
> * Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer
> * Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer
> * Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
> * Shopping, buying or product recommendations
> * Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks

These are then elaborated on in SU's [What topics can I ask about here?][4] page.

It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues **specific to your topic and your community**.

[**How do I troubleshoot when I have no clue where to start?**](https://superuser.com/a/260078/697)

These attract a *lot* of users.

And don't just answer with a hyperlink to some other discussion group somewhere. Do everything you can to really overkill it.

Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site.

This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) [post on meta.hermeneutics.SE](https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49); I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.

> I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
> 
> 
> ###Vote on Questions
> Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
> 
> If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.

Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)

> ###Vote on Answers
> Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
> 
> *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*
> 
> To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).
> 
If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!
> 
> If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.
> 
> ###Final thoughts
> 
> If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
> 
> To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)
> 
> 
> ###Encourage others to vote!
> 
> Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:
> 
> > Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.

Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

<li>the theory and simulation of 3d printers</li>
<li>a sensor, actuator or controller for a 3d printer</li>

<li><strong>Electronics theory</strong>: Questions which are more general electrical engineering questions and have no real relation to 3d printers are better off at <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Generic programming questions with no relation to 3d printers should be asked on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>

<li><strong>CAD/CAM</strong>: Questions about computer aided design and manufacture should be be asked on <a href=""http://engineering.stackexchange.com"">Engineering</a>, unless they are related to 3d printing, in which they are fine here.</li>

<li><strong>Life Questions</strong>: Questions about choosing how to spend your time (what book to read, which class to take, what 3d printer project to construct, what career to pursue, etc.) may be about difficult decisions, and they are often important, but they are too specific to your own situation and are unlikely to help future visitors to the site. They would be better off asked in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216"">3d Printing Chat</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Generally speaking, if your question is directly related to <em>3d printers</em> then even if your question might <em>also</em> be appropriate on another site, we are likely to be happy to see it here.</p>

<p>Please <a href=""/search"">look around</a> to see if your question has been asked before. It’s also OK to <a href=""/helpcenter/self-answer"">ask and answer your own question</a>.</p>

<p>If your question is not specifically on-topic for $SiteName, it may be on topic for <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"">another Stack Exchange site</a>.

However there is special site dedicated for that: [Hardware Recommendations SE][1] (tag: [3d-printer][2]), so it's actually on-topic there. And similar for software, check for [Software Recommendations][3].

This also provides the SE network with more appropriate traffic based on the question at hand.

However, if the question of ""*How can I change the thermistors settings in Marlin firmware?*"" were to arise, then the question would be best suited here on 3D Printing. It might help both SE sites by providing links to each other's relevant questions for future users to reference.

If the question was something like ""*How can I wire a hotend?*"", this would be more appropriate here on 3D Printing SE as users in Electrical Engineering SE may not know as much about the topic compared to users in 3D Printing. This may be a poor example, but the idea is that there is strict correlation between *hotends* and 3D printing, whereas identifying thermistors is not a specific topic to just 3D printing.

**Update**

After reading a few posts on SE meta, [this one](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work) leads me to agree with you that this particular question may not have needed to be migrated. However, it exposes an important question of how we want to proceed with questions like this in the future? How far down the rabbit hole do we want to allow this site to go in this topic? I'd recommend others pitch in recommendations in answers here on what would be the appropriate topic in this case that can be applied to our [On-Topic][1] page so that it may be amended.

Questions like this are probably best asked in the [Chat][1] room. Currently, it's not very active, but hopefully if we have a few people interested in these more ""off-topic"" questions the activity will pick up. Pings are going to be a very useful tool if we're going to try and utilize the chat window more. Pinging some of the highly active users may help get quality answers to those off-topic questions.

The 3D printing industry is both blessed and cursed in terms of development. While software and general usability is relatively easy compared to traditional manufacturing technologies, the general lack of digital feedback from the machine makes it difficult for the end user.

With this in mind, I find it difficult at this point in time to include 3D printing-related formulas. Most other math-based questions will most likely be [Electrical Engineering][1] related or [Software][2] related which I think is still a grey area here on the 3D printing site.

 - The question deals with a problem that is relevant to the users of this site

 - This site can provide a more specialized answer than electronics.SE can provide: you don't just need to know whether it's a 10k or 100k thermistor, but also figure out the correct thermistor table in your firmware. electronics.SE does not have knowledge of 3D printer firmware, which is the issue underlying this question.

<p>We ask and answer questions about 3d printers, control systems, control theory, algorithms, actuators and sensors.</p>

<p>We feel the best <em>3d printer</em> questions have links to pertinent datasheets or code, but if your question generally covers …</p>

<ul>
<li>a specific 3d printer design or implementation problem</li>
<li>the theory and simulation of 3d printers</li>
<li>a sensor, actuator or controller for a 3d printer</li>
<li>algorithms or techniques for 3d printing</li>
</ul>

<p>… then you’re in the right place to ask your question!</p>

<p>Some kinds of questions aren't allowed here:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping recommendations</strong>: Questions which ask ""which product or library should I use"" or ""Where can I buy X"", are considered <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">shopping recommendations</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Electronics theory</strong>: Questions which are more general electrical engineering questions and have no real relation to 3d printers are better off at <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Generic programming questions with no relation to 3d printers should be asked on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>

<li><strong>CAD/CAM</strong>: Questions about computer aided design and manufacture should be be asked on <a href=""http://engineering.stackexchange.com"">Engineering</a>, unless they are related to 3d printing, in which they are fine here.</li>

<li><strong>Life Questions</strong>: Questions about choosing how to spend your time (what book to read, which class to take, what 3d printer project to construct, what career to pursue, etc.) may be about difficult decisions, and they are often important, but they are too specific to your own situation and are unlikely to help future visitors to the site. They would be better off asked in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216"">3d Printing Chat</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Generally speaking, if your question is directly related to <em>3d printers</em> then even if your question might <em>also</em> be appropriate on another site, we are likely to be happy to see it here.</p>

<p>Please <a href=""/search"">look around</a> to see if your question has been asked before. It’s also OK to <a href=""/helpcenter/self-answer"">ask and answer your own question</a>.</p>

<p>If your question is not specifically on-topic for $SiteName, it may be on topic for <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"">another Stack Exchange site</a>.

 - [What is the best 3D modeling software for a beginner on a 3D printed mini barrel project?](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2665/what-is-the-best-3d-modeling-software-for-a-beginner-on-a-3d-printed-mini-barrel)

On almost any Stack Exchange (barring [Software Recommendations](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/)) this type of question would be shot down immediately, as they are quite problematic:

 - Too broad: a very large range of software packages can be used to do almost anything. Without sufficient details in the question, it's impossible to narrow down an answer to a few software packages.

 - Primarily Opinion Based: the best software package is generally the one you're most proficient with. As such, people are likely to recommend packages based on what they're already familiar with, rather than what is truly the ""best"" choice.

[This meta post](https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information) on software recommendations lays down some guidelines on what constitutes a ""good"" software recommendation. Basically, a question should identify precise requirements, in order of importance, that the software should have. I think neither of the example questions achieve this, since they basically boil down to ""I want to model an X"" but give no indication of what features they need from the software, what operating system it should run on, what their budget is,...

 - Are the current questions acceptable?

 - Should we adopt SR's guidelines?

You are empowered a lot more than you know.

Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

First, overlap between sites is fine. *It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else*; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.

I do agree that, so far, the [tag:legal] questions have not been great. But in the future, they could be. I wrote in [a comment](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/103/is-it-legal-to-make-a-weapon-with-a-3d-printer#comment123_1030)
> I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.

Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.

We have the same situation here. Some [tag:legal] questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for. The legality of Filament A could be really important to a project.

That's not to say that all [tag:legal] questions are fine. As has been said, some of the ones we've had so far haven't been great, and I would advocate sending them to Law. But I strongly disagree that just because of the examples we've seen we should not allow [tag:legal] questions. There are good ones out there; we haven't seen their full extent yet.","5"

Someone left a comment below your question stating that your question was related to a [more narrow question][1]. I would recommend editing your question to explain your situation a bit more. Here are some good points that you can provide users to make it easier to answer:

 - Does your print require specific mechanical properties (ie high strength, heat resistance, electrical conductivity, flexibility, etc.)
 - Does your print need to ""look pretty""
 - What type of 3D printing technology are you wishing to use (FDM, FFF, SLS, etc.)

Answering some of these questions will definitely provide users with more direction as to how to answer your question. As it stands right now, your question will result in the general response: ""Well, it depends on what you're trying to make..."".

I'm sure that I'm not the only one here that has a few different types of material available at any given point as result of various projects (ABS, PLA, PVA, TPE, etc.).

I have been an active user of several Stack Exchange sites since 2012, but have finally now found a site that I really can contribute to. 

As a robotics engineer by education, I early got interested in the art of 3D printing, and decided to join the community for myself in 2014 when I graduated from university. Over the past two years I have experimented with my trustworthy Kossel Mini printer to the point where I now need to set new challenges to still have something to do. Taking part in the Stack Exchange 3D Printer community has provided me further challenges and learning potential, which I truly appreciate.

I already spend a lot of time on this site, and try to help new users uphold the quality standard found on SE sites, answer questions and finish the review queues whenever possible. Overall, I am very proud of how this site has turned out so far, and would very much like to help it progress further. 

To me, taking on further tasks of moderation seems like a natural step, and I hope you will allow me the opportunity to contribute as a moderator in the future.

I personally feel that the question fits within the scope of the community as it specifically requests details on the process of 3D printing.

**Valid Questions:**
> Also can someone explain how human cells can be printed?

> Would this involve some kind of cell-plastic filament?

**Borderline Question:**
> How would the cells survive, etc. Where would you get these cells from and how would you be able to go from using a 3D printer to layer these cells together to then forming an organ out of that?


I don't see how this can be much different than:
> Also can someone explain how *{stainless steel}* can be printed?

> Would this involve some kind of *{granular steel}*?

For the borderline question:
> How would the *{stainless steel bond}*, etc. [How] would you get these {granules of stainless steel} from and how would you be able to go from using a 3D printer to layer these *{granules}* together to then forming *{a solid part}*?

It has... been some time since the site has begun. Normally, pro tem selection process is done very early in the site lifecycle (read: second week). However, in a mix of a mess largely centered around myself, the selection process not only took a while to get off foot, but also took a long time to complete.

All that is done now! I am pleased to announce that these members have stepped up and generously volunteered their time to help us assure that each community’s issues are properly addressed.

To me, it seems that most [closed][1] grey-area questions seem to be related to materials. So, questions that may be considered *too broad* as a general materials question may be a viable question for a newbie to the 3D printing world. A new comer may not be familiar with various material types (ie. PLA<sup>[filament]</sup>, ABS<sup>[filament]</sup>, Stainless Steel<sup>[powder]</sup>, Bronze<sup>[powder]</sup>, etc.).

Focusing on material questions may be a good start to the concern. While it may be technically *too broad* asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object. So, if a user specifies (or hints) the preferred printing method (FDM/FFF, SLA, etc.) then I think we should let people use their better judgment in answering the question.

I do agree with Robert Cartaino when he said:
'_The folks here will work hard to curate this collection of knowledge(...)_'

It's true that SE forums are so valuable also because there are hard working moderators and editors - no doubt.

I also agree with this (but with some objections):
'_(...) when someone finally finds this site through search, the last thing we want to do is send them elsewhere to find that information_'

Being strict, according to this part, linking is not allowed... which is not true isn't it?. I didn't link poor websites or other forums or any information from ""somewhere"" / ""elsewhere"". I did link ""the sources"", pages which are the real sources of the knowledg in the case of asked question. And because these sources are quite big and stable, it's high prpbablility that there were available for long time (till the question and answer will have any meaning) and they will be the most accurate and up to date as possible.

So the question is, should I rewrite such sources just because answer based on links is not allowed or maybe it's better to be not such strict.

Please consider and express what you think about such situations.

ps: I admit my answer could be comment insted of answer and if there will be such will of mods I'll rewrite it as comment as I wanted to help this user (and I think he upvoted which means he gathered the knowledge he asked for).

If the question was something like ""*How can I wire a hotend?*"", this would be more appropriate here on 3D Printing SE as users in Electrical Engineering SE may not know as much about the topic compared to users in 3D Printing. This may be a poor example, but the idea is that there is strict correlation between *hotends* and 3D printing, whereas identifying thermistors is not a specific topic to just 3D printing.

**Update**

After reading a few posts on SE meta, [this one](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/10249/what-is-migration-and-how-does-it-work) leads me to agree with you that this particular question may not have needed to be migrated. However, it exposes an important question of how we want to proceed with questions like this in the future? How far down the rabbit hole do we want to allow this site to go in this topic? I'd recommend others pitch in recommendations in answers here on what would be the appropriate topic in this case that can be applied to our [On-Topic][1] page so that it may be amended.

We've received a few questions along the lines of purchasing references since we've opened in Beta. While I personally don't think direct questions about ""*What is the best 3D printer to buy?*"" are appropriate questions, I'm curious about a potential middle ground.

Should we consider including tags such as [tag:printer-review], [tag:buyer-review], or [tag:printer-reference]? The idea being that certain questions would inherit one of these tags (or something similar) to help facilitate traffic to specific questions. These questions would pose ideally be (in the OP's eyes) useful in making a purchase decision. 

Case in point:
[This question][1], outlining some of the potential relative cons to UV printing compared to FDM/FFF printing, could prove useful to someone looking into purchasing a new UV printer.

This idea can be combined with those proposed [here][2], such as @TomvanderZanden's suggestion to create a series of controlled ""best"" questions.

**Amendment**

I might also suggest that if we, as a community, decide to use such a system have moderators lock these questions to avoid any sort of spam (unnecessary answers). These questions should also be set to ***community wiki*** to ensure that any bias is dealt with as a community.

3D Printing alone makes for a very narrow community if it excludes subtractive manufacturing questions. For example, there is no python.stackexchange.com or javascript.stackexchange.com, all of that goes into one network: stackoverflow.com. That's just the same level of division.

 - [What is the best 3D modeling software for a beginner on a 3D printed mini barrel project?](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2665/what-is-the-best-3d-modeling-software-for-a-beginner-on-a-3d-printed-mini-barrel)

 - [What is a good software for designing car parts](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/2697/what-is-a-good-software-for-designing-car-parts)

On almost any Stack Exchange (barring [Software Recommendations](https://softwarerecs.stackexchange.com/)) this type of question would be shot down immediately, as they are quite problematic:

 - Too broad: a very large range of software packages can be used to do almost anything. Without sufficient details in the question, it's impossible to narrow down an answer to a few software packages.

 - Primarily Opinion Based: the best software package is generally the one you're most proficient with. As such, people are likely to recommend packages based on what they're already familiar with, rather than what is truly the ""best"" choice.

[This meta post](https://softwarerecs.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/336/what-is-required-for-a-question-to-contain-enough-information) on software recommendations lays down some guidelines on what constitutes a ""good"" software recommendation. Basically, a question should identify precise requirements, in order of importance, that the software should have. I think neither of the example questions achieve this, since they basically boil down to ""I want to model an X"" but give no indication of what features they need from the software, what operating system it should run on, what their budget is,...

 - Are the current questions acceptable?

 - Should we adopt SR's guidelines?

 - Should we disallow ""recommendation""-questions altogether?","5"

I think that there very seldom are any *good* questions that ask for printer or software recommendations, and I would therefore vote for them not being allowed in general. 

So far I have handled these types of questions by waiting to see if other users flag them, and then take action after a close vote has been made. If we decide they should be avoided in general, we probably want to put them on hold right away - this would also make the answers much more consistent after eventual edits.

UPDATE:

Another recommendation [question][1] was asked today. The OP wants to buy a 3D printer that can be used for printing dental implants. I believe this question has two possible types of answers:

1. **Highly subjective:** ""Printers made by MkrBot are much better than PtrBot, get the first (...)""
2. **Informational objective:** ""Get a resin based printer because they typically have better resolution than FDM printers (...)""

While the first is almost entirely opinion based, the second can offer some proper insight that will help the OP in search for a specific printer. In these cases, I suggest that we try to guide the OP into formulating their question such that they promote answers of the the second type, rather than the first.

However, this raises the question why are there both? [heated-bed][1] has a short but sensible definition, whereas [heatbed][2] has no tag definition, so it is unclear the intended difference, if any, in their use. 

After a quick search of Meta to see if this issue has already been raised, I, now, see that there is also the tag [hbp][3], see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115/merge-hbp-and-heated-bed-tags.

For completeness, the respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:

 - [tag:heatbed] 5
 - [tag:heated-bed] 34
 - [tag:hbp] 11

So these are my questions:

 - Should these tags be merged/deleted or left as is? It seems a little confusing, as it stands currently. 
 - Which is the preferred term, *heatbed*, or *heated bed*? 
 - Should I add the [tag:hbp] to my question? 
 - Should I remove the [tag:heatbed] tag from my question?
 - With respect to my particular question, should I, also, have created a [tag:heated-bed-support], or a [tag:heatbed-support] tag, or even a [tag:hbp-support] tag, so that it is more appropriately tagged?

[THIS IS REALLY DEVASTATING][1]

We all need to vote up users and try to answer their questions, so we can get more users answering / asking questions. Main reason I'm writing this post is because this is great site, but we need new regular users that are going to vote and ask questions. I think it all came down to 20-30 active users, and rest of users aren't so active.

I'm relatively new to site. I've decided to use it because it helped me a lot, and I'm doing my best to answer the questions. My main concern is also that my answers also don't get any vote up.

So... I'll let it all out. I think that main concern that we need to focus on is motivation.

WE NEED TO MOTIVATE OTHERS TO VOTE. And we all can do that if we vote other users up.

That's from my perspective. Even one vote up motivates you to go further.

I think that I explained what I mean. :) It's all in VOTE UP!

Where do you all think we draw the line? As CAD is very closely coupled with 3d. I could see questions such as ""how to I render this so it prints well"" as a valid question. I am not sure asking for CAD auto processing software really should be topics we tackle. Or do we want to be inclusive to most non specific CAD questions, and let the members who are strong in that area handle it?

However, I would like to at least address an issue I've seen trending. Most of the issue comes from old posts and new, unfamiliar users to the SE network. Anyways, there is an abnormally high number of unaccepted answers.

Specifically, in this moment in time (01/28/2017 9am Pacific US) there are **658 questions** ***with answers***, ***258*** of which have **no answer accepted**. This is ***answer acceptance rate of about 40%***.

Now, I've done this in the past with little payout, but perhaps if we have more eyes on it moving forward. I have gone through the list of questions [here](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano+answers%3A1) and commented on the question to ask the OP if any of the answers helped solve their situation. Something like this:

Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.**


This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) [post on meta.hermeneutics.SE](https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49); I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular **Question Votes** make the site look more active.

> I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is *absolutely critical* to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  
> 
> 
> ###Vote on Questions
> Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.
> 
> If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post [Asking Better Questions](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/) might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, [How to Ask](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask) directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.
> 
Finally, I want to reiterate that **Voting on questions  is free!**  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)
> 
> ###Vote on Answers
> Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  
> 
> *You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!*
> 
> To show that this is true, they've even created a [badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship).
> 
If you think an answer is *useful*, vote it up.  If you think an answer is *not useful*, vote it down.  Either way, **vote**!
> 
> If you need help on writing answers, the meta post [How do I write a good answer to a question?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question) will help you out.
> 
> ###Final thoughts
> 
> If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.
> 
> To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: [Vote Early, Vote Often](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/)

> 
> ###Encourage others to vote!

> Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:

> > Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.

Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.

The 3D printing industry is both blessed and cursed in terms of development. While software and general usability is relatively easy compared to traditional manufacturing technologies, the general lack of digital feedback from the machine makes it difficult for the end user.

With this in mind, I find it difficult at this point in time to include 3D printing-related formulas. Most other math-based questions will most likely be [Electrical Engineering][1] related or [Software][2] related which I think is still a grey area here on the 3D printing site.

The usage guidance for 3d-printer is quite board (""Questions about a specific brand, model, or type of 3D printer."") and 3d-printing does not even have one.

I would suggest to get rid of these tags. For comparison, [Stack Exchange](https://stackoverflow.com/tags) does not have a programming tag either.

I am thinking that we could use a solid message like that, outlining exactly what they need to do, without is having to write it out every time. It is not shown in the copy (hence the link) but there are links in that message.

Thoughts? How can we make this happen?

###TL;DR

Is video inlining disabled on SE.3D Printing, or is it because we are still beta?

If it can be enabled , then should/could it be enabled? 

I personally think it would be useful to enable it, and save a few mouse clicks (and RSI) having to open the video in another tab/window etc. What do other people think?

This user was posting nonsense to your question by copying text from your question and posting it as an answer.

The reason you probably did not see this in the revision history is:

1) it wasn't a direct edit to your question

2) I believe only moderators can see deleted posts.

We need to have at least a rough idea of what is on and off topic to know what the site will be about. Without a least some discussion on this how will mods know when a question needs to be closed? Thats not to say that nothing will change or that we can't refine our thoughts on this but getting a rough draft wouldn't be the worst thing.

Taking the Super User example, we could consider at least a few things, something like this, for example,

On topic for 3D Printing
-
* Specific issues with a 3D printer (e.g. My 3D printer keeps failing prints)
* Real problems or questions you have (e.g. How do I level my 3D printer)

Off Topic
-
* Anything not related to 3D printing
* Opinion based questions (e.g. Which is the better 3D printer?)
* Shopping, buying and product recommendations 
* Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer

Things that we need to decide on
-

* Legal questions (e.g. Can I 3D print a gun)
* Software questions (e.g. questions about Blender for making 3D models specifically to print, on topic or defer to the Blender Stack Exchange site)

This is just a sample of some things I can think of, off the top of my head.

I am a member of a Facebook Group for just the Tronxy X1/X3.

It doesn't always work, depending on the length of time that the question has been posted for and some other factors, but often it does work.

The answer to ""Why?"" is simply because it hasn't been set up by the moderators. Generally, a specific migration ""pathway"" has to be agreed between sites, I think, and only then is that particular SE site *manually added* as an option to the migration dialog. There is a post, from a few years ago, on SE.Arduino - See [Why does the migrate dialog only list Arduino Meta?](https://arduino.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/2340/why-does-the-migrate-dialog-only-list-arduino-meta). 

Actually, I was mistaken, although, I am sure that I heard the above from someone, somewhere. Apparently, it is because SE 3D Printing is still in beta:

> I think it is because we are ""only"" a Beta site. Once we graduate, I
> think more migrating options become available.

The question now is, should we enable it?

I have seen a few (2?) cases where the OP has linked to a video in order to succinctly describe their issue. As Ecnerwal points out in [their answer][1] to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4153/help-understanding-bridge-settings, watching videos, and in particular having to click on a link to watch them, can be somewhat onerous. Having the video inlined, *might* make it less so.

BTW, I don't know what [backend or UX] disadvantages there would be to switching it on.

**This is a limit on how big we can grow if we are only talking about ""3D printers""**

 1. The 3D printing market is growing; but, it is still a pretty small niche compared to broader subjects like Programming, Engineering, Cooking, etc.
 2. 3D printers are really pretty simple compared to the other topics I mentioned above.  There aren't going to be as many questions.
 3. There is a wide diversity of printers and most commercial (non RepRap) printers are supported by the individual manufacturer's forums.

That said, 753 visits/day (which is less than the number of people in the launch) and 2.1 questions/day is pretty pathetic.  I think pretty much every 3D Printing forum, Facebook group, and YouTube channel WAY exceeds those numbers.

**Only being able to ask and answer questions is a BIG limitation**

3D Printing is part of the general Maker Culture and Makers want to not just ask; but, they want to show off and talk about what they make.  That is a lot of what I see on the other venues and that may be why we aren't getting as much traction here.

**We need to find a way to channel the nubies and students here**

I know nubies can be annoying; but, they ask more questions.  Lots of questions on StackOverflow come from students and nubies.

----------
**So, what can we do?**

 1. Broaden our scope from just ""3D Printing"".  The original Beta description is ""tools and applications of 3D printing"" which is a bit wider.  Maybe we should try to get more CAD, scanning, and maybe even CNC questions.
 2. I wonder if Stack Exchange would be interested in getting a booth at our local Maker Faires.  They seem to be willing to partner money with effort and a booth is pretty cheap if we can muster the manpower.
 3. Could we do a [community-ad](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/237281/community-ads-faq).  It looks like they may be [taking requests](https://meta.serverfault.com/questions/9028/community-promotion-ads-2017/9040) now.
 4. Maybe we could partner with someone to do a ""Print-a-thon"" or printing contest.  They could post the results and push the questions to us.
 5. Find a way to connect to schools that have printing and/or CAD classes or after-school activities.
 6. Connect into other student activities that use 3D printing whether it be art or things like Robotics Competitions.

What you want to avoid is ""questions which are too broad, unclear, incomplete or primarily opinion-based"".  That still leaves lots of other acceptable questions to ask like what printers have a specific feature or whether a specific printer has a specific feature. Note the word ""specific"".

There is also a [Hardware Recommendations][1] SE Beta that may work for you.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Why?**

 1. It fits the Q&A model of Stack Exchange
 2. Product pre-purchase questions are probably the number 1 question every new user wants to ask and needs to know ([as Ryan noted][1]).  We should attempt to find a way to help provide that answer.
 3. It provides a bridge to further questions.  Once they purchase a printer, they will have questions.
 4. Since it is the number 1 question for new users, what a great way to draw them to the site.  When they search, they should find this site has the answer. 
 5. It gives us a way to point people on forums here.  I often see links to reviews on forums.  Why can't those point here?  Once they are here, hopefully we will stay and contribute.
 6. It would provide a great source of new content.  The number of new products and new users are growing at an exponential rate.  
 7. If we do it right, it will help users and help move us forward on our Beta Goals.

**Challenges** 

 1. We need to make sure the reviews are well done and are StackExchange style answers.  What I mean by that is that where they will likely have some opinion-based content, the primary content should be based primarily on objective qualities.  Maybe some sort of a ""Style Guide"", limitations on who can post, and peer review would help mitigate that.  I am not that familiar with how to manage that on a StackExchange.
 2. Maybe this is a repeat of #1 - UNIFORMITY.  
 3. Making sure the reviews doesn't become product advertisement / self promotions.

I already have a (messy) [blog][1], and I am not sure if I could also write a blog on here too. I wonder what the score is regarding duplicating personal blogs on to SE blogs? 


----------

###Content
An SE 3D print blog could be a good idea for ***Build Logs***, for example, maybe. Or maybe a page that links to other people's superlative build logs, [David Crocker's blogs](https://miscsolutions.wordpress.com/) come to mind.

Is the blog (unlike the SE Q&A site) allowed to contain ***links to cheap items/suppliers***? Apparently, reviews are allowed, from [Blog Overflow][2]:

> **Review a product**. Reviews don’t fit the Q&A nature of the sites, but these rules don’t apply on the blog!  Between a review written by a random person on the internet and a review written by a user on the site who consistently gets a lot of upvotes, which review would you trust more?

This closed question would have fitted into a blog nicely: https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4279/what-is-3d-printing

----------

###Concerns
So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: 

>**Plan a schedule**. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.

*and*

> **Pick a posting schedule and stick to it**. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.

Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?

> **Have someone holding the reins**. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.


----------


However, it *is* a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like *Bog* Overflow).

I recently put a [proposal on SE Meta][1] to provide another alternative - Community Referrals.

Personally I often don't like Migrating questions.  The OP usually posts the question where they posted it because that is the Community they felt it associates with.  Migrating it often means the Community (and sometimes the OP) looses. Rather than just Migrating questions, I feel a better to also provide a way to ask for help from other Communities.

What do you think?  Would it help our Community?

Essentially any similarly named tags from this site could be provided almost as an Ad on, say, Arduino.SE if someone searches that site for a question or answer related to that tag.

For instance, if someone is searching for information on special pinouts available on the ""MightyBoard"" controller (which is similar to Arduino), then questions available on our site related to [tag:MightyBoard] can show up amidst the regular search results.

This would negate the need for moderators or community members needing to individually refer posts to other sites and provide new sites the opportunity to bring more members in.","2"

The reward system that is baked into Stack Exchange is Reputation and much of Reputation comes from good questions and answers.  This is determined by votes.

I don't think this is working well for our community.  Even the TOP QUESTION often get no votes or at the most just a few - even though they sometimes have over 100 views.

[![Top 3D questions][1]][1]

One of the [most viewed questions][2] in our community had **over 3700 views** and had just 34 up votes.  That is better; but, still pretty low compared to both the view count and the response a top question would receive on other communities.

Without up votes, it can be very discouraging to people that put the time and effort into answering questions.  If we want to grow our community, we need to put more effort into hitting the up arrow every time we think that a question or answer was worth the read.  **Remember questions and answers are what fuels the community.  Lets pay our fuel bills.**

And [Jeff Atwood said to flag these](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/15292/294691).

So I flagged the +1 comment, which was automatically deemed helpful. I then flagged the remaining thanks to that comment as 'no longer needed'. So... why was it declined?

In other words, we could do with another moderator or a change of moderators (Ryan and perhaps me also).

it is:

 - easy to recognize
 - simple
 - contains stylised '3' and 'D' characters
 - refers to 'layers'
 - aligned to SE logo
 - can be color/gray/BW and still well recognized
 - can be simplified (pixelate) to create favico (min size 8x8 pixels ;)

I'm currently using insights I obtained from mucking about with a 3D printer with Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS 1.4 to dive into retrofitting an elderly CNC router (but, as a router, still, not as a printer) with a new control system (presently thinking and have on order Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino CNC shield R3, we'll see how implementation goes on those) and was wondering if I could ask questions here that would overlap, or not, as I don't think there's a CNC/subtractive community similar to this 3DP/additive one in the ecosystem yet.

I actually started out thinking I could just use the same controller setup (there's plenty of stepper driver slots available, and going ""dual-purpose"" cut and print is potentially interesting) but it seems the official GRBL fork is not 2560 compatible, though there is a fork to try and make it so - it seemed more of a sure bet to stick with the ""official"" fork and the common hardware.

Likewise I've seen a bit of chatter about making Marlin switch-hit CNC/3DP, but I get the impression it's not all there yet, and I'm more interested in immediately usable based on current/past efforts than trying to develop new functionality my dang self.","2"

I think it would be helpful to unify them with a tag, but I can't find an appropriate one. Further, several of these questions are tagged with `[heated-bed]` without being about heating, which is somewhat misleading.

Bed leveling is an area in which one may accrue distinct expertise, and as such I would like to suggest a `[bed-leveling]` tag to help experts find and answer questions. The spelling with a single “l” is the more common spelling used on the site and also that used in Marlin's documentation. The tag's ambit could encompass:

 1. Mechanical bed-leveling such as manual adjustment of screws and springs
 2. Software bed-leveling like the [G29 G-Code command][3]
 3. General Z-axis measurement with a mechanical or inductive probe

The tag could also be applied post-facto to questions about printing problems like poor-adhesion, should the solution be found to involve bed calibration.

[This answer][1], to the question https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5768/should-i-print-in-a-well-ventilated-area/ was recently flagged along with the comment:

> The answer seem to suggest that exposure to dangerous fumes may not be dangerous after all. Do we have a policy for erroneous health advice? Do we tolerate it relying on users using common sense when reading advice on the internet? Do we remove it?

Similarly, there was [another answer][2] to another question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5869/danger-in-3d-printing-over-a-lithium-ion-battery/, that raised some eyebrows over its possible dangerous outcome.

So, I am just throwing this out there:

Hopefully the new moderators can keep up the sterling work that the previous moderators have provided up to now... :-)

After a minor marathon session of clearing the backlog, all flags have now been cleared. Hopefully in a way that keeps everyone happy:

 - Some (one or two) questions were migrated to Engineering or Blender, after requests were thrown over to moderators on other sites, and some others were left ""as is"", as they have garnered some answers here on 3D Printing.

It is just that recently there seem to be a bit more of the ""Did you google first, before asking here"" type comments (accompanied by a vote to close), in particular to newbie questions, or at least questions from those new to SE, but maybe not so new at 3D printing. I don't remember these types of comments so much prior to a year or so ago.

While I agree that people need to do research, or at least demonstrate that they have done a bit, if people are coming here and asking an honest question (which is not a lazy homework related - and let's face it, there are not many, if any, 3D printer related homework questions) and that question is from someone genuinely interested in 3D printer with a tangible problem, then seeing as we are not-quite-desperate-for-users but have an issue with user retention, then we should really not be  throwing google in their face - no matter how frustrating a question may seem, or how obvious the answer appears to an old hand.

Believe me when I say that I know how irritating it can get, I have been there myself. I ended up not spending much time on SE.Arduino, for that same reason - in the end most of the questions started to seem nonsensical, repetitive and idiotic... because I had seen the same topics asked over and over again. I realised that I had to take a deep breath and step back a little - just because I knew the answer and had helped too many people before with the same issue, it didn't mean that someone new would not come along tomorrow and ask them same thing. Yes, they should have checked google first, and yes, they should have seen the duplicate question had already been asked. However, maybe they didn't have the luxury of time to spend hours googling, or maybe they had not used the right search terms, or maybe English isn't their mother tongue, or whatever. However, it didn't mean that they needed to be made to feel daft. 

After all, if someone asks a question here, it probably isn't because they want to wind us up and make us angry - why would they do that? And it can't be judged as lazy, because, let's face it, it takes longer to formulate and ask a question on SE than it does to search something on google.

A couple of friends of mine, independently, sent me this image which, while it made me laugh, also (rather sadly) sums up the ""Why are you asking me that?"" mentality that StackExchange is perceived as having by the wider techy internet community - this is *not* a good reputation to have..!

So, all I am trying to say is, when you see a question asked by someone with a rep of 1, be nice and try to encourage them to stay, rather than scaring them off as soon as they set foot through the door. Don't forget it is probably there first question here and are quite nervous as to how they will be perceived (as one generally is when approaching a new group of people and having to ask something).

The statistics of the [3D Printing][1] on [Area51][2] show that only few items (questions and visits per day) are not up to par and need work. Do those need to reach a level of let's say ""okay"" before the site can loose the Beta stage?

I'm interested to know what would be the requirements to get out of the Beta stage.

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely?

#Stats progress#

 - *Questions per day* **2.1** -> 1.9
 - *Answer rate* **96%** -> 93%
 - *Users*
  - *200+ reputation* **56**/150 -> 103/150 
  - *2,000+ reputation* **4**/10 -> 8/10

Does anyone have a good suggestion regarding this? Should the question be re-tagged? Is a new tag even required? 

The question is currently tagged under [tag:print-quality] and [tag:bed-leveling]. Are these sufficient? They don't really seem appropriate. Is there an already existing tag that would fit?

I thought of  `tag:object removal`, `tag:print removal` or `bed scrapping`, but they all sound a bit off (except, maybe, for *print-removal*). What is the technical term (if there is one), for those in the know, for this activity?

**[These terms are absolute synonyms. At the same time they can be interchangeable.][1]**

---------------------
In digital video, photography, television and film, post-production refers to the tasks that must be completed or executed after the filming or shooting ends. This includes tasks such as the editing of raw footage to cut scenes, insert transition effects, working with voice and sound actors, and dubbing, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks. Post-production is the third and final step in film creation. It follows the pre-production and production phases. ([source][2])

 [tag:post-production] has no description whatsoever.

After looking at https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/70710/what-are-tag-synonyms-and-merged-tags-how-do-they-work, We can make [tag:post-processing] the master and [tag:post-production] the slave **synonym**. This would seem to be a logical relationship given the number of questions tagged respectively. This relationship can be easily removed, if deemed to be incorrect.

If, after some time, everyone is happy with this arrangement, then the two will be **merged**.

Does that sound like a plan and does anyone have any objections..?

Post-Processing typically refers to additional steps that must/can be done to produce the nominally desired part. These steps can include deburr, grind, and other additive/subtractive processing on the physical part.

Post-Production typically refers to any steps that typically do not ""produce"" or alter the dimensions of the product. These steps can include final visual and dimensional inspection, packaging, and sometimes even shipment.

#Accept Answers#

I have mentioned the [accepted answers issue][1] before as well in a separate post, but there are currently [571 unaccepted-answer questions WITH at least 1 answer available][2] out of 1,467 as of 06/06/2018 11:12pm UTC-7 (Pacific). That's almost **40%** of our content ripe for reputation. That equates to **8,565 reputation** points just by purely accepting one of the available answers.

I've periodically used the link above to retroactively remind users that they can approve of an answer. There's nothing wrong with reminding users in the comments, so long as it is asked appropriately. If you don't know how to word it, feel free to steal my wording from the post above.

#Vote#
I'm not the best at remembering to vote, but I typically vote both on the answer(s) that helped me AND the question(s). I think questions easily get overlooked in the voting process, but it does help our newer visitors.

As for Toonis' answer in the comment. I don't think that there is a way to create an answer for someone else. Functionality like that could be abused to achieve higher reputation. It's up to Toonis to create his/her own answer.

However, it is seen site-wide where users will create an answer attributing to the comment of another user. I think it is unspoken law that you remove your answer if the user ever creates their own answer. Ultimately, there are some users that just don't care about the reputation, so they would prefer to use the comments instead.

So, don't be afraid to create your own answer off of someone else's comments. Having explicit answers in the system will only make our site stronger.

I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

###TL;DR - Suggested topics

Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:

 - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)
   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][4]*
   - Shopping 
   - First printer
   - Best printer
     - Overall
     - For specific task
   - Best software
 - Software issues
   - Firmware
   - Tools 
   - 3D modelling (same as **CAD**?)
 - Websites (could come under **Software** and/or **Tools**)
 - CAD
   - Overlap with SE.Blender?
 - Printer DIY
   - Repair and maintenance (both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers)
   - Construction
 - Components (could come under **Printer DIY**)
   - Thermistors is a good example - Print Services
 - Scanning
   - Also 3D Reconstruction ([example][5])
 - Bio-printing
 - Models
   - Feasibility
   - Availability
 - Sharing recommended settings
 - Legal issues
   - Copyright (i.e. Lego)
   - Guns/Weapons
   - Insurance (fire damage)
 - Filament
 - Makerspaces
 - Non-3D Printing related
   - CNC
   - Laser
   - Routers
   - Vacuum Forming
   - Parts assembly ([example][6])
 - Misc
   - Not strictly 3D related, see **Non-3D Printing related** above
   - Anything 3D related
   - Other
     - FFF
     - FDM
     - SLA
     - DLP

----

WRT **Components**, and taking the [thermistors question][7] as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we *could* theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc. 

Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the *too-broad-black-hole*, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.

------

###Additional suggestions in the future

Instead of posting a new question, it *might* be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.

However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.

*Admittedly, this is a bit of a slippery slope, and I certainly am **not** advocating that all closed questions get re-opened but I was going through [some of] the closed questions last night and it is a shame that a few were closed due to the narrow (maybe strict?) guide lines that were set initially. If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276, for some select closed questions.*

***One thing that I did see was that the closed questions, also seem to get automatically deleted. This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers. So this raises the question that whilst, yeah, close the obvious shopping answers, should the associated information/knowledge that resides in the answers be lost, or not displayed, because the question was auto-deleted? Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?***

---

I have been browsing a number of [closed questions][1] and came across a lot of ""Best first printer"" type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example (locked/wiki) question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.

Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.

Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?

I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? 

If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of ""Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?"" or ""It's a shopping question!""

Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?***

---

###Preamble

*Admittedly, this is a bit of a slippery slope, and I certainly am **not** advocating that all closed questions get re-opened but I was going through [some of] the closed questions last night and it is a shame that a few were closed due to the narrow (maybe strict?) guide lines that were set initially. If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276, for new topics pulled from some select closed questions.*

###Beachcombing the closed question pile

I have been browsing a number of [closed questions][1] and came across a lot of ""Best first printer"" type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.

Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.

Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?

I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? 

If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of ""Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?"" or ""It's a shopping question!""

Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.

###Summing up

So, the point of this post is, should we save this information somewhere, and if so, in what format? I envisage a number of possibilities:

 - Blog post
 - Locked question
 - Closed, but not deleted, question - if this is possible
 - A community wiki type post

1) This functionality needs to be explicitly outlined in our On-Topic page!

2) Any of these types of questions should be created by a moderator and immediately ""converted to wiki"" (see mod options)

3) The question should outline an expected format for the following answers. For example, in the case of ""Best Printer"" questions:

    **Make**: {Enter Manufacturer}
    
    **Model**: {Enter Model #/Name}
    
    **Type**: {Select tag: [FDM,SLA,SLS,DLP, etc]}
    
    **Pros**: {Provide details of benefits}
    
    **Cons**: {Provide details of downfalls}

4) Answers MUST follow the outline provided in the question or risk being deleted.

5) (Optional) Answers should be converted to wiki","2"

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta. 

I think that you *should* ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-) 

Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, *you* think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).

If it **does** end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.

I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have *bad post days* sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)

Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind. Often, I have found, whilst writing and clarifying a question, that I had actually mis-understood the whole issue in the first place, and sometimes re-working a post can help me find my own solution (especially when using peoples comments to adjust the original post), or at the very least, help me get my head around the issue.

###TL;DR - Don't over think this, just post your question :-)

The statistics of the [3D Printing][1] on [Area51][2] show that only few items (questions and visits per day) are not up to par and need work. Do those need to reach a level of let's say ""okay"" before the site can loose the Beta stage?

I'm interested to know what would be the requirements to get out of the Beta stage.

**EDIT** July 5, 2018:

It appears that the ""visits per day"" is ""excellent"" with over two thousand visits. The ""questions per day"" still lack behind with a 1.5 value while more than 5 is considered ""healthy"".

> [*... voting is the engine that drives the reputation economy*](https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1447/4152). 

I think Mech had a little different scenario than does 3D Printing, but it still holds true. If you want people to show up and do things, you (and everyone else) needs to vote. Up, down, sideways ... doesn't matter. They all help drive people to *do things* in every Stack.

Looking at the above link, you can see one of the things which is important to graduation is having the right user base. You have to have people who have the ability to do things which only those who have met the point level can do. As it stands the highest ranked person by point total is [Tom van der Zanden](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/26/tom-van-der-zanden). He hasn't (as of this writing) broached 10k points. There are two users who have more than 5k points, and another five who are over 2500. How do you improve this scenario? You guessed it, by voting. 

I realize with sub two questions per day (QPD), there's not a lot to vote on. That can be overcome as well. Those of you who have had issues or have met challenges have knowledge. Write down those challenges you've faced in a question. Then, either write an answer for them, or let someone else figure them out. Either way, you are creating opportunity for the site to expand. That opportunity will be giving someone a chance to vote and/or answer the question. Plus, you are doing what SE wants done in the first place: *bringing and recording knowledge*. It's a win-win.

There's a ton of other things which can be done to get 3D Printing graduated. I'm sure we'll get there sooner or later. I hope I can help in some small way. I'm not the bastion of all knowledge to get a site graduated, that's for sure, but having gone through it with Mechanics gives me some insight.

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely?

Do we need to create tags for every printer out there or list them by type?

My reasoning for creating tags for all brands/types is that people that have a problem with their printer search on their printer brand/type and the problem. E.g. people with an Anet A2 will most likely not search for ""Display of my Prusa i3 clone is not working, help!"", I rather think it contains the ""Anet A2 in the phrasing"". I do however think that that we should create synonyms to the mechanical type like Prusa, Delta, CoreXY, Cartesian.

Does that make sense? Have I understood correctly?

As an example, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns *all* cartesian printers, but especially Prusa, you would have to manually tag that question [tag:AnetA2] and [tag:Prusa] and [tag:cartesian], so that it gets grouped in such a way, where Cartesian, Prusa and AnetA2 are subsets of the previous (super)set. I don't think you can internally link the tags, if you see what I mean, that mechanism doesn't exist.  

Likewise, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns *all* prusa printers (but *not necessarily* all cartesian printers), you would have to manually tag that question [tag:AnetA2] and [tag:Prusa] and *maybe* [tag:cartesian].","5"

The print-material tag clearly states that it is different from material:

> Print-material, in comparison to the tag 'material', helps to specify that the question is concerned with the material the print itself is made from. This includes 'filament' as a subgroup but also SLS polymers for example.

Where as [tag:material] states, more or less, the same thing:

> For questions about compatible 3D printing materials.

> For questions regarding 3D printable materials such as whether a material is capable of being 3D printed, optimal 3D printing parameters (ie. extrusion temp), mechanical properties of materials, etc.

To me, even though [tag:print-material] states that it differs from [tag:material], I can't really see the difference, *unless* material is a superset of print-material, and not only confined to being printed, but also construction of a printer (i.e. acrylic, wood, steel, aluminium, etc.). If the latter, then the description of [tag:material] is a bit misleading and may require expansion.

Can someone explain?","2"

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

While I tried to add the appropriate names for these kit-printers, I feel that it technically is inappropriate for these to actually *have* this tag. Even as the DIY tag contains the ""assembled from a kit by the end user"" in the wiki, there is also non-commercially in it, meaning it seems to be meant for a true DIY kits like [Hypercube][1] or such. They are so vastly different, that I fel we should encourage the following:

* pull any comercial kits out of the [tag:DIY-3d-printer] tag
* add a tag [tag:Printer-kit-assembly] for questions that struggle with the assembly of a kit together with the specific model's tag
* enforce the specific tag of the kit for questions having problems with it

The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasind [earlier][1].


But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!

1. ""I want to buy X. Where to get it?""
2. ""I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?""
3. ""I wonder about X. Has anyone encoutered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?""

All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concearning one:

Question 2 is more a ""LMGTFY"". There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.

Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass<sup>donkey</sup>. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a seperate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as 

 1. all affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] 
 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)
 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.

Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (""Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?"") And there are questions that are what the RPG-StacK-Exchange calls ""Shopping & Recommendation"". They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these ""locate a real world place that does X"" cases. Imho we shouldn't  answer to a question like ""What is a good first printer?"" or ""Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?"" or others of these kind. Maybe the gringe case of ""Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?"" is ok too, but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.


So, in fleshing out our community:

**Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?**

While I tried to add the appropriate names for these kit-printers, I feel that it technically is inappropriate for these to actually *have* this tag. Even as the DIY tag contains the ""assembled from a kit by the end user"" in the wiki, there is also non-commercially in it, meaning it seems to be meant for a true DIY kits like [Hypercube][1] or such. They are so vastly different, that I fel we should encourage the following:

* pull any comercial kits out of the [tag:DIY-3d-printer] tag
* add a tag [tag:Printer-kit-assembly] or use [tag:printer-building] for questions that struggle with the assembly of a kit together with the specific model's tag
* enforce the specific tag of the kit for questions having problems with it

The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasing [earlier][1].


But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!

1. ""I want to buy X. Where to get it?""
2. ""I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?""
3. ""I wonder about X. Has anyone encountered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?""

All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concerning one:

Question 2 is more a ""LMGTFY"". There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.

Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass<sup>donkey</sup>. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a separate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as: 

 1. All affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] 
 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)
 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.

Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (""Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?"") And there are questions that are what the RPG-Stack-Exchange calls ""Shopping & Recommendation"". They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these ""locate a real world place that does X"" cases. IMHO we shouldn't  answer to a question like ""What is a good first printer?"" or ""Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?"" or others of these kind. Maybe the gringe case of ""Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?"" is ok too, but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.


So, in fleshing out our community:

**Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?**

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

That does seem sort of reasonable. A DIY printer should be one that has been sourced from various parts. Or should that also include (or be exclusively) DIY designs? I mean, DIY means DO It Yourself, so a commercial kit, is literally a DIY printer, even though it is following a recognised design. It may seem a pedantic point over semantics but what is called as DIY:

 1. A true home brew, DIY design? And everything made from scratch with a lathe and possibly another 3D printer?
 2. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github and printing the parts yourself
 3. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but buying the parts (because you don't yet have a printer)
 4. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but a complete kit
 5. Buying a commercial printer available as a kit, in kit form.

To me, there is not much difference between the last two,if the commerical printer is derived from a RepRap. Even 2 and 3 as just as DIY as eachother, really.


So, just to play devil's advocate, here are four real word scenarios... 

 - Would you class a P3Steel as a DIY [tag:diy-3d-printer] tag *or* as a printer-kit [tag:printer-building] tag *if* the frame was purchased as a kit from Poland, but the rest of it was sourced separately from various places, such as Chinese eBay vendors? 
 - Likewise, a Kossel, whose plastic parts were bought from a eBay vendor and then the aluminium struts were cut to length on the streets of Bangkok - would that be a commercial kit (because the plastic parts were available commercially), or DIY? 
 - Also, a Wilson II, whose plastic parts were from MJRice (the designer of the Wilson), but the aluminium came from a cottage industry aluminium extruder in Vietnam. Commercial kit or DIY tag?
 - Now, twisting it slightly... What about a complete Wilson II kit? Where the entire frame and kit has been purchased from an eBay vendor, or MJRice. Is that commercial or not? 

There seems to be a fine line between the last two. We might need to be very specific in the tag definitions if people aren't going to get confused.

If, all four examples are DIY then fine. If none of them are, because the plastic parts were purchased, then ok, we have a *very strict* definition of DIY.

Just for completeness, the first three scenarios are my personal purchasing experiences, where I considered them as DIY printers.

Now, to be fair to your question, I *think* I know what you mean. You are referring to printer kits from established manufacturers that are available pre-built, *or* as kits. Is that right? I just want to clarify what defines a commercial kit and a DIY kit.

Does that make sense? I might have got a bit carried away.","2"

Now, to be fair to your question, I *think* I know what you mean. You are referring to printer kits from established manufacturers that are available pre-built, *or* as kits. Is that right? I just want to clarify what defines a commercial kit and a DIY kit.

That does seem sort of reasonable. A DIY printer should be one that has been sourced from various parts. Or should that also include (or be exclusively) DIY designs? I mean, DIY means Do It Yourself, so a commercial kit, is literally a DIY printer, even though it is following a recognised design. It may seem a pedantic point over semantics but what is classed as DIY? Is it:

 1. A true home brew, DIY design? And everything made from scratch with a lathe and possibly another 3D printer?
 2. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github and printing the plastic parts yourself
 3. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but buying the plastic parts (because you don't yet have a printer)
 4. Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but a complete kit
 5. Buying a commercial printer available as a kit, in kit form.

To me, there is not much difference between the last two, *if* the commercial printer is derived from a RepRap. Even 2 and 3 are just as DIY as each other, really.


So, just to play devil's advocate, here are four real word scenarios... 

 - Would you class a P3Steel as a DIY [tag:diy-3d-printer] tag *or* as a printer-kit [tag:printer-building] tag *if* the frame was purchased as a kit from Poland, but the rest of it was sourced separately from various places, such as Chinese eBay vendors? 
 - Likewise, a Kossel, whose plastic parts were bought from a eBay vendor and then the aluminium struts were cut to length in the back streets of Bangkok - would that be a commercial kit (because the plastic parts were available commercially), or DIY? 
 - Also, a Wilson II, whose plastic parts were from MJRice (the designer of the Wilson), but the aluminium came from a cottage industry aluminium extruder in Vietnam, who you had had to walk miles to find. Commercial kit or DIY tag?
 - Now, twisting it slightly... What about a complete Wilson II kit? Where the entire frame and kit has been purchased from an eBay vendor, or MJRice. Is that commercial or not? 

There seems to be a fine line between the last two. We might need to be very specific in the tag definitions if people aren't going to get confused.

If, all four examples are DIY then fine. If none of them are, because the plastic parts were purchased, then ok, we have a *very strict* definition of DIY.

Same with making trivial changes to firmware, using a complex software tool for a trivial task, etc. If the task is common, relevant and bounded then a 'hand-holding' answer here will be much more valuable/findable than pushing questioners to a more specific site. Once people move from trivial use of these tools they may well end up needing to self-educate before they reach a point that EE.SE, or SO will accept their questions.

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Today however I came across this article, [32 GB versus 32GB: Almost everyone is writing it wrong][1], by chance - I was actually looking up SD cards - and it summed up things pretty well. I'll let you read it. 

However, the rules are as follows:

 - non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) before *all* SI units, including bytes

Except:

 - degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds ("") (for angles)

See also: [Wikipedia: International System of units - Lexicographic conventions][2] :

> The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21 kg, 7.3×102 m2, 22 K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%) and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C). Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ′, and ″), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.


I must admit that *I* didn't realise that it applied to °C and %, as well... oops!

If you're contacting different vendors for a jammed bearing, a miswired stepper motor, or a dead controller board, it's DIY.  If you talk to the same person regardless of which part is defective out of the box, it's not DIY.  So, from Greenonline's examples, 1, 2, and 3 are DIY, while 4 and 5 aren't.

Yes, that means that a printer can evolve from ""not DIY"" to ""DIY"".  For example, if you start with a preassembled Prusa i3 Mk3, but then replace the V6 hotend with a Volcano hotend in an extruder found on Thingiverse, switch to a 320-watt Meanwell PSU, replace the display with a touchscreen, change out the ball bearings for sleeve bearings, upgrade the steppers for more precision, and install a BuildTak bed, you've now got a DIY printer.","2"

There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the `.moderated` newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.

SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. *Anyone* can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question *back into review/improve mode*. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... *happen*.

### Why do we close a question?

The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on *problems you face* or things you are trying to understand. The [don't ask](https://crypto.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask) section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:

* Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.
* Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.
* Some questions belong elsewhere.

These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, *broadly speaking* true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.

### Is closing like deletion?

No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put ""into improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for *anyone* to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.

### What are the requirements for closing a question?

If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.

If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""this question does not belong here"". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.

### Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?

Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is *your site*. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.

### Ok, so how does it work?

![Example close button][1]

Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:

 * Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.

![Close vote reasons dialog][2]

 * If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.

![Other votes][3]

 * The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.
 * The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a ""migrate to"" list, but that is not implemented yet.
 * The other options are straight out closes.
 * Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.
 * If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.
 * Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.

###Answer in a comment


    Did any of the posted answers solve your issue? If so, please mark it as the accepted answer. If not, then either refine your question or please post your comment above (which appears to contain the solution) as an answer, and then mark it as accepted in 48 hours, in order to remove your question from the unanswered queue. Answers are not allowed in comments, and may be deleted. If your answer is posted as an answer then it becomes searchable and may help others with the same issue.

###Limit Comments


    On stack exchange, it is better to edit your question to add information requested in comments, rather than adding more comments. Comments are for helping to improve questions and answers, and are distracting, so we try to keep them to a minimum. If all of the information needed to answer the question is contained within it, the comments can be tidied up (deleted).

    All of this information can be edited into your question to make it easier for people to answer your question. If all of the information is contained in one block then people don't have to read all of the comments to discover all of the information.

###Ask a good question


    I would recommend that in addition to reading some highly voted questions to gauge the standard expected, that you take a look at the help section relating to [asking](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/asking) questions, in particular [How to ask a good question](https://3dprinting.com/help/how-to-ask), and take the [tour](http://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tour) for more information on how stack exchange works. Thanks :-)





###Unbounded questions


    Welcome to SE Robotics <user>, but I'm afraid that Unbounded Design Questions are off-topic because there are many ways to solve any given design problem, so questions that ask for a list of approaches, a subjective recommendation on a method (for how to build something, how to accomplish something, what something is capable of, etc.) or shopping selection are off-topic. We prefer [practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask). Take a look at [How to Ask](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask) & [tour](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/tour) for more information on how stack exchange works.

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely?

#Stats progress#

 - *Questions per day* **2.1** -> <strike>1.9</strike> 1.6
 - *Answer rate* **96%** -> <strike>93%</strike> 95%
 - *Users*
  - *200+ reputation* **56**/150 -> <strike>103/150</strike> 113/150
  - *2,000+ reputation* **4**/10 -> <strike>8/10</strike> 9/10
  - *3,000+ reputation* **3**/5 -> <strike>4/5</strike> 6/5
 - *Answers per question* ratio is **2.0** -> 1.9
 - *visits per day* **753**  -> <strike>4</strike> 2,324

------

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][2], to [“Graduation” of this Community][3]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

 - Prompting user to accept an answer - *in order to clear the unanswered question list*
 - Problems with comments
   - Answer posted in comments - *Solutions to the question posted in the comments, do not show up in searches*
   - Limiting comments  - *Additional information, that **may or may not** have been requested is posted in comments, rather than as an edit to the question*
 - Poor quality questions
    - Ask a good question
    - Unbounded questions
 - Poor quality answers
    - Short answer - *Terse answer, no explanation provided*
    - Repetition - *No new information, the contents of a previously posted answer is repeated by a different user*
    - Link only answer - *Only a link is provided, with no summary, or content, of the link included*
    - Question posted as answer - ***Another** question, (possibly) related to the OP's question, is posted as an answer*
    - ""Me too"" answer - *""I **also** have this issue""*
    - Edit to a previous answer - *user posts second answer with additional information, not realising that there is an edit button for their first answer*

Today however I came across this article, [32 GB versus 32GB: Almost everyone is writing it wrong][1], by chance - I was actually looking up SD cards - and it summed up things pretty well. I'll let you read it. 

However, the rules are as follows:

 - non-breaking spaces (`&nbsp;`) before *all* SI units, including bytes

Except:

 - degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds ("") (for angles)

See also: [Wikipedia: International System of units - Lexicographic conventions][2] :

> The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21 kg, 7.3×102 m2, 22 K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%) and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C). Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ′, and ″), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.


I must admit that *I* didn't realise that it applied to °C and %, as well... oops!

I recently put a [proposal on SE Meta][1] to provide another alternative - Community Referrals.

Personally I often don't like Migrating questions.  The OP usually posts the question where they posted it because that is the Community they felt it associates with.  Migrating it often means the Community (and sometimes the OP) loses. Rather than just Migrating questions, I feel a better to also provide a way to ask for help from other Communities.

What do you think?  Would it help our Community?

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

#Stats progress#


 - *Questions per day* **2.1** -> <strike>1.9</strike> 1.6
 - *Answer rate* **96%** -> <strike>93%</strike> 95%
 - *Users*
  - *200+ reputation* **56**/150 -> <strike>103/150</strike> 113/150
  - *2,000+ reputation* **4**/10 -> <strike>8/10</strike> 9/10
  - *3,000+ reputation* **3**/5 -> <strike>4/5</strike> 6/5
 - *Answers per question* ratio is **2.0** -> 1.9
 - *visits per day* **753**  -> <strike>4</strike> 2,324

------

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

According to SE.3D Printing user stats at [Area 51](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing) we need more questions and a solid group of users to assist in moderating the site. 

The amount of questions are hard to control, but could be increased by the avid users by posting questions and answer those themselves (e.g. about problems you encountered while gaining experience in 3D printing, this is perfectly legal and documents the gained experience to be shared with others). Another aspect is the solid group of users. According to the stats page:

> We recommend: 
> 
>  - 150 users with 200+ rep (currently 130 users with 200+ rep) 
>  - 10 users with 2,000+ rep (currently 10 users with 2,000+ rep) 
>  - 5 users with 3,000+ rep (currently 7 users with 3,000+ rep)

<sup>Quote taken at July 31, 2018</sup>

This implies we are short on 200+ rep users (20 people). This can be influenced by voting! There are so many questions unaccepted and a few do not have an answer, so there is a lot of reputation points to be awarded.

Please vote, not only answers, but also on questions. Please do also downvote to keep the quality high, but leave a comment why you downvote, when this answer/question is then modified to address your concerns please revisit to review your vote again.","2"

> Also, consider this, we don't have a single 10k user right now. If we were to graduate today, the only people who would have access to moderator tools would be ♦ moderators. The problems are even worse further down the reputation scale, we only have 6 users with 3k or more reputation, who aren't already ♦ moderators, so only these 6 people would be able to cast ordinary close votes.

Our case is very similar. We have (click [here][2]):

> Also, consider this, we don't have a single 10k user right now. If we were to graduate today, the only people who would have access to moderator tools would be ♦ moderators. The problems are even worse further down the reputation scale, we only have 6 users with 3k or more reputation, who aren't already ♦ moderators, so only these 6 people would be able to cast ordinary close votes.

Our case is very similar. We have (click [here][4]):

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

#Stats progress#


 - *Questions per day* **2.1** -> <strike>1.9</strike> <strike>1.6</strike> 2.1
 - *Answer rate* **96%** -> <strike>93%</strike> <strike>95%</strike> 96%
 - *Users*
  - *200+ reputation* **56**/150 -> <strike>103/150</strike> <strike>113/150</strike> 139/150
  - *2,000+ reputation* **4**/10 -> <strike>8/10</strike> <strike>9/10</strike> 10/10
  - *3,000+ reputation* **3**/5 -> <strike>4/5</strike> <strike>6/5</strike> 7/5
 - *Answers per question* ratio is **2.0** -> 1.9
 - *visits per day* **753**  -> <strike>4</strike> <strike>2,324</strike> 2648

------

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

This script was made for Stack Exchange. The name of the add-on is: [AutoReviewComments](https://github.com/Benjol/SE-AutoReviewComments). There is a complete write-up on it over at [StackApps](https://stackapps.com/q/2116/54833), which is SE's site for just this sort of thing. 

One of the great things about it is it's completely customizable. I've found since I've been sneaking around here on 3D Printing, it automagically sets the ""welcome"" note to the current site, as well as if there are custom comments you've added on another site won't show up here. That's pretty kewl in my book. One of the things you could do is to create custom comments within the add-on copied from the other great Answers in this Meta post. ","2"

 - They all relate closely to the same techology: CNC control, axis, CAD modeling, G-Code, etc.
 - It would extend the possibilities of this SO page, which seem to struggle to get questions.

I would however not accept very different technologies: molding, vacum forming, welding, etc. :

- Those are too different from the original 3D-Pringer topic.
- I would orient the community toward hobbyist, ejecting the professional community, and this is something to avoid.

Speaking about renaming the SO, I would recommend something like:

 - 3D Printing and CNC systems
 - 3D Printing and Digital fabrication

Granted that some questions are really only in need of a single (obvious) answer, I think we're missing something here.

I've seen a few questions with 'answers in the comments', which is understandable if a user wants to make a drive-by quick tip, but we should really be encouraging them to try and come back later to get the points due to them.

Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might loose them rep? Or by an overly high (assumed) expectation for making an answer?

What can we do to raise ApQ, without dropping answer quality significantly?

 - Questions per day
 - Users vs Reputation
 - Visits per day

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

#Stats progress#


 - *Questions per day* **2.1** -> <strike>1.9</strike> <strike>1.6</strike> <strike>2.1</strike> 2.7
 - *Answer rate* **96%** -> <strike>93%</strike> <strike>95%</strike> 96%

 - *visits per day* **753**  -> <strike>4</strike> <strike>2,324</strike> <strike>2648</strike> 2675

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools

Referring to [this post][1], almost all of the stats are improving (albeit) slowly, except for one, the ApQ 

> Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might lose them rep?

It seems that way. Without wishing to provide a link to the actual comment, I noticed a comment the other day that suggested as much, and a nicely detailed comment was left instead. 

To be fair, I feel that way sometimes, and often hesitate (maybe rightly so to save myself from spamming the site) in posting questions on SE.Meta, as there are a number of drive-by downvoters there<sup>1</sup>. Unless you have a definite bug that you are able to document clearly or have a well rounded proposal that can be implemented easily, then your question may end up downvoted. This is probably rightly so, TBH, in most cases, but nevertheless it can be discouraging.

If you don't have much hard-earned rep then you may be less willing to risk it by posting a informative answer, that only answers half the question.  Is that a bad thing? Well, it is a double edged sword. It is a good thing, because that promotes good solid answers, but with the downside that you point out (a lack of multiple answers per question).

What can we do? Probably, not much other than creating a small community by promoting a friendly environment and communicating more clearly... Inviting people to chat in the chatroom, being more welcoming (with Hi and welcome), actually helping people without the old ""Did you google this?"" immediately.  All of these things help a lot. And which we seem to have developed of late. So we seem to be getting there.

I know that a number of members have already been adding answers to single answer questions as well as tackling the unanswered queue too. The more people that help the better...

Granted that some questions are really only in need of a single (obvious) answer, I think we're missing something here.

I've seen a few questions with 'answers in the comments', which is understandable if a user wants to make a drive-by quick tip, but we should really be encouraging them to try and come back later to get the points due to them.

Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might lose them rep? Or by an overly high (assumed) expectation for making an answer?

What can we do to raise ApQ, without dropping answer quality significantly?

 1. **Questions that are too broad for which we have expertise**. Example: [How to build the cheapest but safest laser engraver][1]. For these questions, we generally know how to respond properly, but the questions are so ill-defined, that the whole thread becomes a mess.
 2. **Questions that are too broad for which do not have expertise**. Example: [Am I allowed to publish a 3d scan of a [Buddha] statue?][2]. These questions are formulated properly, but we lack the expertise, and so everybody chimes in with ""half knowledge"".
 3. **Questions that are narrowly defined**. Example: [What voltage does the Creality Ender-3 run at?][3]. These questions can be solved with one answer.
 4. **Questions that are well-defined, but have multiple solutions**. Example: [Noise Reduction][4]. These are some sort of ""medium size"" questions, neither too broad so as to invite opinions, but not too narrow so they can be completed with one answer.

I think, to raise both the quality and the quantity of threads here, we should reduce questions of type 1 and 2, and restrict it to questions of type 3 and 4.

In my opinion, type 1 questions should be marked off-topic, closed, too broad or whatever designation exists. Type 2 questions should be moved to another Stack Exchange site.

I had a look and the Wikipedia entry, [Cura (software)][1] doesn't appear to suggest that.

So I wondered if it was a marketing thing.

After all, over on SE.Arduino, *lots* of people write ""Arduino UNO"" - I myself did so to, for a long time, until Nick Gammon [picked me up on it][2]:

I *think* that the reason that I did was that the Arduino pages write it in that way (arguably incorrectly) and it just seems to be a branding/marketing ploy.

So, is this the same sort of thing with CURA? I am just wondering where it started and came from?<sup>1</sup>

I don't think this site lends to having a huge amount of ApQ's, because usually there is only going to really be one answer which will work. I think the ApQ category was based more towards the programming/tech sites. I mean, when programming, there's almost ALWAYS going to be more than one way to answer a question.Then when you look at other sites where there is advice given, like Travel.SE or Law.SE, you could possibly see a plethora of answers for each of their questions. Then you take WorldBuilding.SE and it's a whole new level.

IIRC, when Mechanics.SE graduated, we had sub 2.0 ApQ. I don't think 3D's is out of line with that and it isn't going to hurt the site for graduation.

While multi-ApQ is not a bad thing, it only works if the question deserves it. If the question isn't answered correctly or if there might be something else which could be the answer, then multi-ApQ is an awesome thing. To make answers for answer sake, just to boost the ApQ, that can be ugly. A much better idea is (IMHO), to upvote good Q/A's and downvote bad ones.

I completely agree with moving the site forward, but my suggestion is to move it forward in the right direction by putting energy where energy is needed.

I spent some time thinking about questions I have been asked by friends who purchased FDM machines and were starting to undertake their own designs.  In particular, among the engineers I hang with there is a desire for the generally-accepted-as-valid design principles -- the design rules that, when followed, will usually work.  I haven't come across a reference that lays out such rules for FDM printing, and so I launched a question which someone who knew of such a rule set could answer, or which I could later attempt to answer if a better answer didn't appear.

I asked [this question][1].

The question drew a ""have you googled that?"" response, coupled with a helpful link.  Other comments ensued, along with two down-votes on the question.

My question here is in two parts:
Is this an appropriate activity -- to ask a question hoping to receive a better answer that I would write myself, and
If the motivation for the question is appropriate, how should the question have been better formed?

I realize that two downvotes isn't all that important, but it is important to me to understand and act in concert with the community culture.

However, it *was* backed up with an extremely useful link and a query for clarification so it may not have been meant as a straight forward ""Have you googled this""-esque comment.

I reworded that comment slightly, to soften it.

I think that the negative votes probably reflected the accompanying [too broad] close votes.

However, as I mentioned in [my comment][3], your question didn't seem that broad to me, or rather, while it might have been *seen* as being a *little* broad, it seemed no broader than your linked to question or other examples that I've seen. *Note that this is my personal opinion, and doesn't mean that the question shouldn't be closed, or, conversely, should be left open.

We need to focus as a community on taking questions which don't quite fit, and improving them, otherwise we will not get people coming back with more questions and later helping others. There is still a focus amongst some members on only answering specific 'problem' questions, rather than generating a comprehensive resource covering the whole subject. SE intends to be the top search result (and presumably the answer and un-informed student was looking for).

Maybe 'design rules"" seems to broad, when you presumably care about the factors that are unique to FDM. (i.e. exclude all the general engineering principles which would be common to subtractive machining, injection moulding, etc. even though they are obviously still relevant). I feel this was kind of implicit in the question, but some may have been mislead by the terminology.

Should tolerances be included? With an electronics background rather than engineering, `Design Rules` implies a final sign-off stage check of low level trivial detail rather than the entry point to the design flow.

I think the question also suffers slightly from a _I have an answer in mind, so it seems that I'm asking the question in a way that leads to that answer_, kind of an X-Y of getting the answer posted (in this case, the answer is the true goal, not the question).","5"

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

For some time, I felt the site had either picked up some bad stats, or was in the final stages of fading away. I think things are a little more normal now though.

It seems that we still have a bit of a problem with becoming sticky for lots of users. We're at 151 200 rep users (out of 10k), and [IoT][1] is at 149 out of 7k, so it seems maybe we're not too far apart. The big difference seems to be the number of views. 1.2k per day on IoT, and 2.8k here (maybe expected since views depend on visibility of the site spreading over time).

Are people really coming here and finding answers to their questions? Are they coming here and asking a single question? Are we on the wrong end of cheap printers with poor support, holding back the really interesting questions?

Looking at the questions so far, the vast majority are discussing the part cooling fans, or the distinction between part cooling and extruder/heatbreak cooling. I don't see any questions about specifically cooling the circuit board as was indicated in the tag wiki for [tag:print-fan].

Given the potential confusion about what a fan is for, and the lack of a need so far to identify questions about PSU cooling, a single [tag:fans] tag still makes sense.

I've seen a few questions with 'answers in the comments', which is understandable if a user wants to make a drive-by quick tip, but we should really be encouraging them to try and come back later to get the points due to them.

Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might lose them rep? Or by an overly high (assumed) expectation for making an answer?

>Tbm0115 - ""support-material"" should define the material-type (ie. PLA, ABS, PVA, etc.) which in FDM is usually the same as the print-material. However, in the case of machines like dual-extruders can be completely different. The print-material for the body of the part can be PLA while the support-material can be PVA. 

>Support-structure defines the ""style"" of structure that is generated by the slicer. For instance, I can have a scaffolding-like structure to support bridges and spire-like structure for small overhangs. Personally, I view infill as a subset of support-structure because it is material that is meant to support the overall body including ceilings. With infill I can have square, hexagonal, even cat-like styles of support structure.

>Trish - I agree on the structure being more about style (Trees, pylons, towers, included in the design or not, everywhere or not) while support material is more a subset of filament - PVA is one of those, but also one could use (in a dual extruder) ABS on a PLA print, and then remove the supports with acetone or some other stuff. One might use a super low melting filament and remove with heat.","2"

We only need ONE [tag:filament] tag and then any tags for specific material (e.g.[tag:pla] [tag:abs] [tag:petg] [tag:PVA] [tag:TPU] [tag:PC]) groups that have specific properties (e.g. [tag:Flexible-Filament] [tag:conductive-filament])

* The difference between [tag:Thermoplastic-filament] and [tag:Plastic-filament] in use is nonexistant and both are pretty much identical to filament in the current use - it is rather random which one gets used, in many cases more than one is used.

* There is no filament that can be used in 3D printing that is not a thermoplastic, as the method to re-shape the filament via heat demands a thermoplastic.

* While there are clearly more plastics than thermoplastics, non thermoplastic plastics are not useable for 3D printing unless you would design a whole printer to use for example an UV-curing resin delivered to the workpiece via a needle - which makes this a non-FDM printer.","5"

So, I am withdrawing my solution for the moment, as I am not sure that I agree with the amalgamation of the two tags. However, *if* they are to be amalgamated then I would propose that this would be the way to do it...

--------

<strike>You might not like this temporary solution, as you state that synonyms aren't needed...

I can make [tag:support-structures] and [tag:support-materials] synonyms of [tag:support], *for the moment* (so swapping the [tag:support-structure] and its synonym [tag:support] that I did yesterday and add [tag:support-materials] as a synonym of [tag:support]).

Then *later* they can be merged into [tag:support], once any issues (or non-issues) have been raised or pointed out - or if there are any serious objections later on down the line, the synonyms can be easily removed and reverted (whereas a merge can't be).

Does that sound like a acceptable plan?</strike>","5"

which is as 0scar has already stated, i.e. TPU ∈ TPE. It goes on to say:

So they don't seem ***exactly*** the same. I dunno, I'm not sure. However, we apparently have the tags already, so that isn't a major issue anymore. 

With regards to the synonym aspect: Are the questions going to to be the same, i.e. will the same issues happen to both TPU and TPE, or will TPU have special, particular issues? If the latter, then a synonym maybe isn't a good idea.

Regarding [tag:flexible], I wonder if it is necessary. Aren't we trying to reduce the number of filament tags? See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/fixing-the-filament-tags. If having [tag:flexible] will help in this direction then all well and good, otherwise, maybe it isn't.

However, I'm not a filament expert. You can decide what you want to do and if you need me to do it, message me in chat or leave a comment.

The first 2 were [Personal Manufacturing][1](before my time) and [Digital Fabrication][2](I tried and failed).

Now I am faced with a situation where I want to ask a question about DIY Polystyrene foam milling (I was researching a bit of [foam casting][3] for a micro-hydro turbine wheel), and I don't have a convenient SE site to ask it.

So my question is that, is it possible to expand the scope of the 3DPrinting SE to a more general scope, in particularly 3D Milling, given that a LOT of the underlying tech IS shared?

I am asking this because a lot of the people involved in the first 2 failed proposals are participating here and may be able to help answer my questions (and further, despite the site's title, this [answer][4] advises a more inclusive approach).

I think the general consensus is that CNC and laser cutting machines fall in the same category as 3D printers with respect to control, axis, modeling, etc. as the difference may be the tool the positioning head is carrying. 

My general concern is if you want to include this, does the name of the site cover the content? ""Makers.SE"" is suggested, but that would include even more ""hobbyist machines"" that at least fall very much out of this scope (like the mentioned vacuum forming).

When we keep the name 3DPrinting, it should be about 3D printing, if the scope is extended (which is perfectly defendable for CNC machines and laser cutters based on similarity), the name should be changed (if that is possible). 

I'm not in favor to change the name as it might scare people away or may cause people to not find the site. At the moment we are already doing everything we can to get out of the Beta phase.

 - Questions per day
 - <strike>Users vs Reputation</strike>
 - <strike>Visits per day</strike>

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

#Stats progress#

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

The first 2 were [Personal Manufacturing][1](before my time) and [Digital Fabrication][2](I tried and failed).

Now I am faced with a situation where I want to ask a question about DIY Polystyrene foam milling (I was researching a bit of [foam casting][3] for a micro-hydro turbine wheel), and I don't have a convenient SE site to ask it.

So my question is that, is it possible to expand the scope of the 3DPrinting SE to a more general scope, in particularly 3D Milling, given that a LOT of the underlying tech IS shared?

I am asking this because a lot of the people involved in the first 2 failed proposals are participating here and may be able to help answer my questions (and further, despite the site's title, this [answer][4] advises a more inclusive approach).

*Minor Addendum: I would love being able to ask questions related to even [Dave Gingery's work][5] here, but that's a very long way off (It would've definitely been on-topic for Personal Manufacturing).*

I mean that if, in order to print Material X on my printer, I need to print at 30mm/s with a temperature of 220°C and an enclosure, it is highly unlikely than another printer can do it without the enclosure, at 80mm/s with a temperature of 190°C. (Those are completely random numbers.)

Materials behave similarly no matter the printer, thus such advice might help people and draw some more people in as those Q&A would appear on Google searches.

I think what would also bring people would be to do this for non-standard materials, ie not PLA or ABS, but stuff like wood and glow and carbon-fibers and so on.

What do you think?

You might wonder why the the model makes such a difference. The difference is that instead of maintaining a database with settings for all material brands and or types, you now have a specific problem for a specific application that could be answered rather than having endless discussions over how people print a filament at which settings.

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Ok, yes, a screenshot is probably easier to do and post, and will show a familiar UI and be easy on the eye and make it easy to notice errors/improvements. 

However, having a (standardised) text format would make it *searchable*. After all, other sites always say, ""please copy and paste the error rather than post a screenshot"" - because the text in a screenshot is not searchable. 

Yes, it could/would be a pain to enforce this rule (is it possible to easily export printer settings as a file file?) and/or edit the text version of the settings into the post.

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

However, as far as I'm aware, exporting settings in text format from a slicer/printer is still wishful thinking due to many factors.

I remember a long conversation on the Ultimaker forums a few months ago about this very proposal: being able to export settings in some form, to make it easier for people who are experimenting to follow the various iterations of settings more easily.

Some people asked for text format, csv, odt, etc, but the people of Ultimaker ultimately crushed the hopes of everyone by explaining, in technical terms that I did not completely understood, that it wasn't possible without rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.

Thus why we're stuck with screenshots for the foreseeable future.","2"

I was able to spot a few problems already using the screenshots.

Another thought: ""What would you gain by searchable settings?"". In case of error messages I am absolutely convinced that you should, but I do not see the advantage for searching/indexing. 

What does being searchable actually add? Questions and answers are usually not that long to spot certain text when you are on a page, what does it add if it is searchable for the site? E.g. if I would search for `combing`, you now get some hits, if everyone posts the settings in text you suddenly have many more you need to scroll through...","5"

Furthermore, it is probably also easier to find (when they are separated), either through the site search or through Google.

We have maintained a great answer rate here on 3D Printing SE with a answer rate of 96%. I believe this rate has been maintained since day one and it's hard to keep up, especially with fluctuations in user activity.

However, I would like to at least address an issue I've seen trending. Most of the issue comes from old posts and new, unfamiliar users to the SE network. Anyways, there is an abnormally high number of unaccepted answers.

Specifically, on 01/28/2017 9am Pacific US, there are **658 questions** ***with answers***, ***258*** of which have **no answer accepted**. This is an ***answer acceptance rate of about 40%***.

Updated to 11/16/2018 10am CET, there are **1682 questions** ***with answers*** (of a total of 1788 questions), ***706*** of which have **no answer accepted**. This is an ***answer acceptance rate of about 42%***, although improved, it is still very low!

----------

Now, I've done this in the past with little payout, but perhaps if we have more eyes on it moving forward. I have gone through the list of questions [here](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano+answers%3A1) and commented on the question to ask the OP if any of the answers helped solve their situation. Something like this (see also meta posting [Do we have Standardised Comments?](/questions/303/do-we-have-standardised-comments)):

> Hello @[UserName], I noticed your question has been up for a while now. Have any of the answers below been able to solve your question? If so, would you mind accepting the appropriate answer. If not, what is missing so that we may help you further? Also, if you have figured it out on your own, you can always answer and accept your own solution. Thank you.

This should hopefully ping the user. Also, going through these questions may bring up questions that may need moderator attention/intervention.

Hopefully we can tackle this issue and get some other users more reputation in the process.

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

*Where applicable, replace `<username>` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*

Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:

1. As *block quotes* for readability
2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&P &#x2398;**)

There are four sections:

 - General Comments
 - Comments
 - Questions
 - Answers

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

I agree about the posting of the entire configuration file or G-code in a question is too big to fit, etc. What is really needed, and I've thought this for a long time, is a SE sanctioned version of PasteBin [functionality]. A persistent scrapbook/scratchpad site internal to SE (like the i.stack.imgur.com site) where *over-sized* chunks of code/configs/text can be pasted, without it being an external link (which carry the inherent risk of link death).

While there certainly are [Moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) here, a significant amount of the *moderation* is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
   
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
To that end, here is how the moderation done here on 3D Printing breaks down by activity over the past 12 months:

¹ ""Community"" here refers both to [the membership of 3D Printing](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users) *without* [diamonds next to their names](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators), and to the automated systems otherwise known as [user #-1](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/-1).

² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.

³ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 3 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 3, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.

⁴ Includes close flags (but *not* close or reopen votes).

Or, as [Shog9 put it](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/346651/4751173):

> They're ordered *first* by the minimum reputation needed to access the queue, and *then* alphabetically by the name of the queue.

> The purpose of this ordering is to keep the list as consistent as possible *until your privilege-level changes* - the hope is that folks use this as their primary means of accessing the queues, and as such we're not forcing reviewers to override their muscle-memory every time they go to access a specific queue - a worthy design goal for a menu that appears on just about every page of the site.

[![Suggestion for topic policy][1]][1]

So, basically, on-topic would follow the formula:

`(formingMethod == additive OR substractive) AND (instrument == machine)`.

Off-topic would have the formula:

`(formingMethod == transformative) OR (scale == mass) OR (instrument == human)`

This is just my suggestion and I invite everyone to put forward their argument, if they think, that a better strategy or community can be created, if the boundaries are to be moved or the criteria re-defined.

Vacuum forming on an individual/batch scale, for example, would be a topic, that is close to the other ""green fields"". If we want vacuum forming to be on-topic, we would have to give up the ""transformative"" criteria. I'm sure, there are other points like this.

I also assume, such a strategy would have to be adapted in the future, when these methods have either matured, have been adopted by the masses, or other methods have been discovered.

If it does interest you, please post up an answer to this question with where you might think would be a good place to advertise. Usually, the other site would need to relate to this one in some way. It's been my experience if it doesn't relate, the ad will get shut (or shot) down. 

If you feel you have the artistry to create an ad for another site, post that up, too! We can critique the work and ensure most everyone likes the idea before posting it over. We really do want to put our best foot forward! There are some rules in making an image:

- The image that you create must be 300 x 250 pixels, or double that if high DPI.
- Must be hosted through our standard image uploader (imgur)
- Must be GIF or PNG
- No animated GIFs
- Absolute limit on file size of 150 KB
- If the background of the image is white or partially white, there must be a 1px border (2px if high DPI) surrounding it.

If you have some ideas and would like to discuss, you can also post ideas or questions a little more free form over on the [site chat](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room).

If you like the idea, please let everyone know! ","2"

As we learn and grow our own knowledge, things we once considered hard become easy.

Now, our answers often address issues that are *pretty easy* to fix by tweaking **simple things** like...

* leveling the bed
* fixing the settings in the slicer 
* [replacing a broken endstop for a new part][1]
* [correct replacement nozzle][2]
* pretty 2/3rd of the questions in [tag:Troubleshooting]

At other times, we clearly go into **advanced** repairs and fixes, for example:

* [flashing firmware][3]
* [small alterations of the firmware][4]
* [installing new capabilities to a printer][5]
* most of the remaining 1/3rd of [tag:troubleshooting], usually for the points above

And then there are at times rather **complicated** things, for example:

* [sifting through the firmware to find when one function is actually called][6]
* the remaining [tag:troubleshooting] turns out the be this, because of the oddity of the problem.

##Call
Let us make a rough guideline what rough level of expertise we expect from a common user and how to address the required level of details in answers!

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

 - Italics are used for notes

 - Questions per day
 - <strike>Users vs Reputation</strike>
 - <strike>Visits per day</strike>

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

However, I know that I'm not representative of the average *just-bought-a-printer-and-now-have-a-problem* type user and for those users, your list and ordering probably makes much more sense. The ordering would also be equally valid for a *printer-builder* user, as they are for a *straight-out-of-the-box* user, I guess.

However, I don't know if we can *expect* any user of the site to have any *particular* certain level of expertise. I guess that can only be ascertained by the reading of their question and how they answer any follow up questions that might get raised. Only thereafter could any answers be tailored to best match their level of understanding.

So, I guess what I'm saying is that a guideline would be good/interesting/cool to have, be what happens if a certain user doesn't have that rough level of expertise which is expected? We would still have to play it by ear, as we have been doing so, I think is the answer.

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

*Where applicable, replace `<username>` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*

Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:

1. As *block quotes* for readability
2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&P &#x2398;**)

There are four sections:

 - General Comments
 - Comments
 - Questions
 - Answers

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

##Printer and basic settings

The most basic problem when we have to help is, that we often don't know what the setup is. So, we need stuff to help in identifying what the user is actually using. But how does the user know? They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:

The second answer to that question more or less states that if the user isn't asking how to download or hack, but just has a basic issue with the software, which *a licensed user would also encounter*, then it isn't a problem... apparently.

Also [this post][3]:

Yep, [performance could be an issue](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/279637/295232). Also, malicious users could post links to videos with ... questionable ... content (though this could be alleviated by requiring some reputation to post embedded videos, just as some sites do with pictures).

The question now is, should we enable it?

I have seen a few (2?) cases where the OP has linked to a video in order to succinctly describe their issue. As Ecnerwal points out in [their answer][1] to https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4153/help-understanding-bridge-settings, watching videos, and in particular having to click on a link to watch them, can be somewhat onerous. Having the video inlined, *might* make it less so.

BTW, I don't know what [backend or UX] disadvantages there would be to switching it on, although there are these [cautionary tales][2].

There are four sections:

 - General Comments

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

For full details of the process, see [the announcement on Meta Stack Exchange](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/314459/experimenting-with-pro-tempore-elections). The timeline:

* Starting on July 1, users can [nominate themselves](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/election/1). Users can also ask questions on meta for potential moderators to answer. (Use the [meta-tag:discussion] and [meta-tag:election] tags.)

* On July 8, if there are two or more candidates, we'll run an election. If not, I'll simply appoint the candidate. (There's a small chance we'll need to [remove a nomination](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/274114/lets-disallow-nominations-from-people-whove-been-suspended-in-the-past-year), but I doubt that will come up.)

* If there is an election, I'll announce the results on meta on July 16. 

(Note for current moderators: there's no need to nominate yourself even though you'll likely get an email saying you should. The system assumes the first election is a graduation election, which would mean moderators would need to be re-elected. This isn't that sort of election.)

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

##Printer and basic settings

The most basic problem when we have to help is, that we often don't know what the setup is. So, we need stuff to help in identifying what the user is actually using. But how does the user know? They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:

What should I do with the question?  As a relatively low-reputation participant, I want to defer to the greater experience.

Many of the problems of 3D printing and laser etching are similar, but not all.  The equipment is much like FDM 3D printers, with some differences.  How finely should we diagnose the nature of the problem before deciding if it is on topic?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

To let you know what's out there, I work at [Hyrel](http://hyrel3d.com). 

Our printers can take [spindle (milling) heads and additional axes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0lvN-aPYHI), and even [diode](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OceUiuTixPA) and [CO2 lasers](https://youtu.be/FnYDoNkgOrI), and they all operate on the same gcode - we tell people E is for Emit as well as Extrude. We even have a [TIG welding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azFY-IqDB_0) attachment. 

We also run our [Fadal CNC machines](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIGeQmXNbNE) on our printer software and firmware. 

To many people this is a natural progression for a well-built 3D positioning system, and I encourage a broader definition.","2"

It should not be flagged. It should be downvoted and a comment left explaining why it is incorrect.

This clearly leads to the question:

> Why don't we delete bad answers?

There is a reason why the standard flag rejection message exists:

> declined - flags should not be used to indicate technical inaccuracies, or an altogether wrong answer

And what is that reason, I hear you ask... 

Well, there's a school of thought that says if one person thinking of something - be that an answer, question, idea, belief or assumption - then odds on, there is at least one other person thinking the *exact* same thing - be is a correct or incorrect assumption... 

###TL;TR

So, if someone posts an answer that regurgitates a mis-understanding, commonly held belief, an internet myth, or what have you, *that has been **proven** to be wrong*, then that answer should most certainly **not** be deleted, but held up as an example of inaccuracy - not to vilify the poster, but rather to re-educate, and hopefully try to stop the self-perpetuating inaccurate fact/myth in its tracks. To do that a down-vote, in conjunction with a comment, can help to do that. 

Note that a downvote alone, without at least one comment, will not - as the poster probably won't understand why they are getting downvoted and just assume that it's some sort of vendetta.

----

###Related Note

There is some confusion with *Not an answer* (NAA) and *Low quality answer* (LQA), of which a technically inaccurate answer (as described above) is neither.

This is how a I personally interpret the flags:

 - NAA:
  - A comment
  - Another question
  - A ""Me Too!""
  - A post that basically contains no answer whatsoever
 - LQA:
  - Random letters
  - Ranting
  - Any other utter nonsense
  - A post that no matter how you edit it, contains no information

By embedding the former only, then this serves the immediacy of the situation, that is to say, to help the OP resolve their issue. Links to third party tutorials, product demonstrations, etc., can be watched, after clicking the link, in separate windows - at the viewer's leisure, without having to tax the back-end servers needlessly, with inline video.

Note that, the core concept is still the same - 3D Printing. However, the scope has been widened in a number of ways/directions. For example:

 - to include technologies which aren't strictly 3D Printing, but where there is overlap
 - to cover 3D Printing related tools, such as scanning, and tools/software used
 - to cover 3D printing related areas, such as modelling, legal issues,
 - and so on.

After the suggested expanded topics list had been sitting around for about a year now, on [Game plan - What is on-topic?][1], and changed/modified throughout the year to accomodate comments/feedback/requests, the proposed list has been moved on to the actual On-topics page, in the Help Center: [What topics can I ask about here?][2]

Yes, it will still need a little tidying up, as it is basically a copy and paste and some additional formatting to make it fit, but at least it's there now - just rough around the edges.

For instance, ""Print Services"" are mentioned as far as on-topic and what is allowed. *To what extent are Print Services* on-topic and allowed? In and of itself, as you've stated it, it could be anything from what to expect to giving them service recommendations (ie: *What's a good place to get xxxx done?* or *Who provides to best services in the Dallas, TX area?*) This isn't the only place where it could be done.

Though I still read those related to the operation of printers, IE the legality around printing dangerous things such as firearms and their parts is unique to the 3d printing and fabrication spaces. 

Honestly I feel that any legal questions should not be handled here unless it's extremely specialized to 3d printing. Copyrights counterfeits and IP are ubiquitous in almost all things sold, so this is not a good candidate. For me, I wouldn't touch a question like this, as if someone gives bad advice, they could potentially be liable, or put stack overflow in a bad situation. (I assume the TOS covers some liability cases). That all seems to be more better suited the [Law Stack exchange][1]. The existence of the stack exchange is the deciding part for me, a community better suited to ask questions related to trade laws. 



No I do not think it should be allowed. 

Note the question is better now that they added Locations, but still doesn't feel right.

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]

1. Recommendation-based questions ***really*** are off-topic, unless very specific indeed - and even then they may still end up being closed.

3. Print services questions, should not be asking for recommended service suppliers, but rather is it reasonable to ask such and such of a print service, or what do they usually provide, or is this a reasonable request to be made of a print service - again, these may only be able attract opinion based answers so again these questions are likely to be closed.

4. One thing to bear in mind is that a lot of questions can only be answered by opinions, but those opinions are usually based in, and backed up by, fact and empirical results. A question asked that requires supposition and thought-experiment type answers are generally purely opinion, and not really (and can not be) backed up by hard facts.

5. Legal issues may be asked, but as we are not lawyers then *I Am Not A Lawyer* (IANAL) should always apply. Generic legal questions can also be asked on [SE.Law](https://law.stackexchange.com).

Some topics such as CNC, and Laser engraving, whilst are not 3D Printing, they share a lot of commonality. Where such questions are regarding such commonality then they ***may be*** considered to be on-topic. As always, all topics are subject to community discretion. For further explanation see [Game plan - What is on-topic?][1]

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

###Update

The list below was integrated into the on-topics page, on the 8<sup>th</sup> June 2019. See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally for *further* discussion.

###TL;DR - Suggested topics

In the list below, 

 - Italics are used for notes
 - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics

Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:

   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][5]*
   - <strike>General Shopping  - *opinion based*</strike>
   - <strike>First printer - *opinion based*</strike>, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*
   - Best printer
     - <strike>Overall - *opinion based*</strike>
     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable, although **speed** as a task is in a **very grey area**... this question [Fastest FDM printer?][21] was closed for being opinion-based*
   - Best software
     - <strike>Overall - *opinion based*</strike>
     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable*
 - Software issues
   - Firmware
   - Tools 
   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)
   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)
 - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)
   - Recommended sites
     - for knowledge
     - for models
     - for online tools
   - Issues with web based tools
 - CAD
   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*
 - Printer DIY
   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)
   - Construction
   - Mechatronics
 - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)

See this [meta answer](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally/416#416) to [https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally). Regarding the question itself it ended up needing the fourth vote and got re-opened. I'll add an *IANAL* type answer at some point.

I agree that it would be more suited to Law, and its generic nature could actually be asked anywhere (and that should be pointed out in any posted answer to the question and/or as a comment to the question)  - however, we could allow just this one example, and any similar questions thereafter can be closed as duplicates against that one, as we have done in the past (have one generic cover-all question/answer that similar questions can be pointed to)...

I read an authoritative answer somewhere about if a question is valid on two different sites then where should it be asked, but I can't find it any longer. However, whilst this question was not cross-posted the aspect of overlap covered in the answers to [Is cross-posting a question on multiple Stack Exchange sites permitted if the question is on-topic for each site?][1] 

> Occasionally, people are interested in different perspectives on the same fundamental question. There are [*many* Stack Exchange sites][2] with overlapping topic spaces and it can be useful to get a ""second opinion"". Even then, however, it's best to tailor your question to each site. Ideally link to the question on the other site and explain what you hope to learn from asking another community.

and probably more *au-point*, [How should we deal with questions that fit on more than one Stack Exchange site?][3]

> If the question belongs on two or more sites, then whichever on-topic site got the question first should probably get priority and keep it. That's where the author is probably more comfortable, or decided was the place to ask.

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

*Where applicable, replace `<username>` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*

Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:

1. As *block quotes* for readability
2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&P &#x2398;**)

There are four sections:

 - [General Comments][8]
 - [Comments][9]
 - [Questions][10]
 - [Answers][11]

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

-----

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

###Update

The list below was integrated into the on-topics page, on the 8<sup>th</sup> June 2019. See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally for *further* discussion.

###TL;DR - Suggested topics

In the list below, 

 - Italics are used for notes
 - Strikethrough is used for definitive no-go topics

Whilst there may be *some* overlap, duplication and/or mis-categorisation, the list of suggested on-topics seems to be, essentially:

 - Recommendations (Hardware and Software)
   - *Note: Usually banned from SE - with the exception of [Hardware Recommendations][5]*
   - <strike>General Shopping  - *opinion based*</strike>
   - <strike>First printer - *opinion based*</strike>, *see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/278/best-first-printer-closed-wiki*
   - Best printer
     - <strike>Overall - *opinion based*</strike>
     - For specific task  - *opinion based but allowable, although **speed** as a task is in a **very grey area**... this question [Fastest FDM printer?][21] was closed for being opinion-based*
   - Best software
     - <strike>Overall - *opinion based*</strike>
     - For a specific task  - *opinion based but allowable*
 - Software issues
   - Firmware
   - Tools 
   - Coding/Compiling firmware (see **Misc - Coding**)
   - 3D modelling (*same as **CAD**?*)
 - Websites (*could come under **Software** and/or **Tools***)
   - Recommended sites
     - for knowledge
     - for models
     - for online tools
   - Issues with web based tools
 - CAD
   - *Overlap with SE.Blender?*
 - Printer DIY
   - Repair and maintenance (*both commercial and DIY repair of both commercial and DIY printers*)
   - Construction
   - Mechatronics
 - Components (*could come under **Printer DIY***)
   - *[Thermistors][6] is a good example, see note <sup>1</sup> below*
   - Help and Recommendati","5"

It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.

*Where applicable, replace `<username>` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*

Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:

1. As *block quotes* for readability
2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&P &#x2398;**)

There are four sections:

 - [General Comments][8]
 - [Comments][9]
 - [Questions][10]
 - [Answers][11]

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

Note those kits will totally blind you. 3d printers are being bundled with everything, really if you look at the things http://diabasepe.com/ is making. (Cool guys btw)

However. To me this is the same as asking about a woodburning kit question in an electronics forum, because they both use soldering irons. If we allow a removal base machines, such as lasers, we will also have to allow discussions about CNC machines.

In the case of that question, they would get bonus points if it was a pure gcode question. Maybe even if it was on a multi use machine.. Instead its asking us to debug their laser setup. Thats not really formatted for stackoverflow anyways. They need to go to a forum. Also as someone that once made a Cheap Chinese laser cutter use a RAMPS 1.4 board, I know exactly how similar they are. But in the end, additive manufacturing isn't this kind of laser (as we have SLA and powder printing)

At first I was this is dead simple not on topic. Thinking about laser and 3d printing is a good counter arguments, but that is not what this topic is. It is not additive manufacturing, and its not being done to a part which was additively made. 

I think its a firm off topic.

Should we split it? Should we weed out those that use [tag:e3d] but mean [tag:all-metal-hotend] instead, and make that tag?

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.


----------


### No graduation, but loosing the Beta label...
Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please look into ""[Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331708/congratulations-to-our-29-oldest-beta-sites-theyre-now-no-longer-beta?cb=1)""

The statistics of the [3D Printing][1] on [Area51][2] show that only few items (questions and visits per day) are not up to par and need work. Do those need to reach a level of let's say ""okay"" before the site can loose the Beta stage?

I'm interested to know what would be the requirements to get out of the Beta stage.


----------
Update September 5, 2019:

It appears that the *""visits per day""* is *""excellent""* with close to three thousand visits. The ""questions per day"" still lack behind with a 3.0 value (*""needs work""*) while more than 5 is considered ""healthy"". All further stats seem to be *""okay""* or *""excellent""*.

In a **comment**, `&nbsp;` does not work (nor does any HTML). Try `ALT+0160` - Or on Windows Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar (or on a Mac, type Option+Spacebar).

Note that it is best to stick with `&nbsp;` in **answers** as the other options are ***impossible*** to see when editing - so the `&nbsp;` serves as a nice visual clue.

We have a lot of questions tagged [tag:e3d]. Some concearn the [tag:e3d-v6], one the [tag:e3d-titan-aero], I think I have seen at least one [tag:e3d-volcano].

Should we split it? Should we weed out those that use [tag:e3d] but mean [tag:all-metal-hotend] instead, and make that tag?

However, IMHO, I think that the site is intended to be more about the mechanics of 3D printing and getting something printed, rather than what you can do with 3D printed objects, as the latter is a extremely broad area, unbounded even. But others *may* have a more broader and more accommodating, view.

The most basic problem when we have to help is, that we often don't know what the setup is. So, we need stuff to help in identifying what the user is actually using. But how does the user know? They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:

I left work for the day without clicking send on my comment, or my answer, and found today that it had closed, locked, and rejected. A comment said it should be rejected for being a hardware recommendation question.  Ultimately it was closed for being off topic.

IMO, both of these reasons are incorrect, and miss the point of the question.

Yes, the OP admitted that they were facing their conundrum because of a long delay from China, but the question was not about vendor A vs. vendor B.  The question was about what the requirements are for a motor in a particular application.  This was about specifications and parts selection, not, in the sense of I think it was intended, a product selection.

The OP wasn't asking about one 3D printer vs. another, or one system manufacturer vs. another.  The OP was asking which of two motors would be more suitable to the application.  This is engineering, not marketing.  This is education, not shilling a vendor.

As for being ""off-topic"", are we rejecting all questions about components and 3D printer engineering problems?  Have we become strictly a user group for off-the-shelf printing systems?

I feel strongly that this should be the place for discussing 3D printing engineering, and use, and tools.  But, perhaps this interest is unique to me, and I should find somewhere else to interact with 3D printing users who have engineering problems.

Have others noticed that the volume of reddit traffic related to 3D printing has dramatically increased in the last few months.  Has reddit become the preferred place for engineering questions?  

As for the user who had the 3D Printing Beta door slammed in their face, IMO both options they presented were sub-optimal, and by closing the question we can't help them either with the choice, or with understanding why.  

It is a shame when a curious OP with a question that is real to them is rejected.

I agree. Whilst I know that other people's opinions do and will differ, myself, I feel that this is on-topic. After all it is not an open-ended recommendation, but rather ""is this suitable?"" Personally, I can't see what is wrong with it and we have quite a few of questions like it, that haven't been closed. 

TBH, this particular question has been playing on my mind ever since it was migrated, and it is a shame if we can't help people with these sort of questions.

I feel like maybe posting a ""Why can't we allow (non-open ended) product suitability questions/recommendations"" meta question, although your question has already done this, I guess.

I know that SE.Electrical Engineering has a similar type of thought process, and I have previously posted some questions asking ""Can I use this component?"" or (more tenuously) ""What can I use to replace such and such a component?"" and they were closed almost immediately - I'll have to dig around to find the examples - and it was quite frustrating that I couldn't get an answer, and I didn't really know where else to turn.  Admittedly, the latter question was/is open-ended... however, if I suggest a component and ask as to its suitability, I personally can't see what is wrong with that, as it isn't open-ended, and more of a yes/no binary question.

I guess one could say that it invites opinionated answers (a bit like my answer to the stepper motor question, which after re-reading could be read as just my opinion, I suppose.

Even so, it is still a shame as it would tend to put people (especially new comers) off from approaching SE again, as they may perceive that SE has a rather strict set of guidelines as to what can be asked and what can not. However, that is more down to SE's rules as a whole, which we can't really debate here.

However, that said, it isn't like this particular SE site is so inundated with questions that we can't bend the rules a bit. Most of the time we are lucky to get one or two questions a day...

At least it wasn't closed immediately and the OP was offered some guidance in the comments and answers before it got closed. Well done to all for that.

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

Status: **TBD**

We have both a [tag:repair] and a [tag:maintenance] tag with 10 and 25 Questions respectively. Repair is described as:
> Use this tag to indicate the actions or activities to undertake to fix an item or a process.

while Maintenance is
> Questions about general maintenance and upkeep of printers.

I would like to redraw the distinguishing line, which is rather blurry:

* Maintenance can be replacing worn parts, which also could be seen as repair if it brings a machine back to specs.
* some maintenance tagged questions are also [tag:troubleshooting], which means they could equally well be tagged repair
* other maintenance tagged questions are tagged with [tag:replacement-parts], which would imply a repair of the first type happening as part of routine maintenance (and could arguable count as a repair)

As those tags are rather similar, we need to find a solution:

1. Redraw the line and distinguish better, maybe recategorize parts.
 * maybe [tag:model-repair] vs. [tag:Printer-maintenance]?
2. Merge the tags into one or the other (maintenance is more inclusive), alias one to the other?
3. Keep as it is?
4. Other?","2"

Re 1: Note that while CNC is (barely) on topic, vinyl plotters are not. One could summarize us better as ""Methods of additive manufacturing and machines that share same or similar motion systems"".

Re 2: yes and no: A better term would be ""digitally controlled"" as printer boards aren't full computers, but 3D pens would be technically on topic as a quite close topic (they use the very same filament as printers usually).

Re 3: The main scope is Assembly and Maintenence as well as Troubleshooting of the machines used. It extends into design and postproduction to the degree it is specific to the tools of the trade. Your first example is usually Off Topic (unless it's an assembly for a printer component), while the second is somewhat careful to look at: How to prepare a surface for further postprocessing is usually filament dependent and thus in scope.

Is the intention of SE that questioners (within one particular activity they undertake) will tend to ask questions on one site, or do we expect sites to have very narrow, non-overlapping scopes and place the onus on questioners to determine the correct site?

In other words, if I cross-country ski and also 3D Print, clearly questions about each activity should go to different sites.  But, within cross-country skiing, would questions about waxing be directed to a materials science site, questions about packing the snow be directed to a landscaping site?  Or, would they all fit within cross-country skiing?

I know this isn't a clear answer.  To the extent that I may take a position, I would encourage someone who has found this site to stick here until they clearly can be better served elsewhere.

A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:

While there certainly are [Moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) here, a significant amount of the *moderation* is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
   
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together.

Print`bed` is the carrier for the `build-plate`. For example, whenever we talk about a ""glass bed"" we actually mean a glass `build-plate` that is mounted on a heated bed. Springsteel usually is correctly referred to as build surface. BuildTak and other build-surfaces are bonding directly to the bed. The distinction is pretty much along these lines:

* The mechanical moving system and heater is a `bed` or `heated-bed`
* The area directly in contact with the extruded plastic is the `build-plate`
* The plate in contact with the curing resin in an SLA printer would be the `build-plate`

Status: **Done**/split up

[Takeover from Summer 2019][1]

We have a lot of questions tagged [tag:e3d]. Some concearn the [tag:e3d-v6], one the [tag:e3d-titan-aero], I think I have seen at least one [tag:e3d-volcano]. As of today (updated), there's a pair of [tag:e3d-hemera]/(formerly: [tag:e3d-hemes]) and a single [tag:e3d-v5] on a very old question.

Should we split it? Should we weed out those that use [tag:e3d] but mean [tag:all-metal-hotend] instead, and make that tag?

* It has been split.

You heat the bed. You print on the build plate. In some cases, these may be a single item.","5"

The [tag:y-axis] or [tag:z-axis] hold the [tag:carriage], which levels the Print[tag:bed]. The [tag:bed] can be heated and is the carrier for the [tag:build-surface]. For example, whenever we talk about a ""glass bed"" we actually mean a glass [tag:build-plate] that is mounted on a heated bed. Springsteel usually is correctly referred to as build surface. BuildTak and other build-surfaces are bonding directly to the bed. The distinction is pretty much along these lines:

* The mechanical moving system is under the [tag:bed]
 * the heating effect of this makes it a [tag:heated-bed]
* The area directly in contact with the extruded plastic is the [tag:build-surface]
* The plate in contact with the curing resin in an SLA printer would be the [tag:build-surface]

Technically, there might be a renaming needed closely related:

* [tag:glass-bed] to [tag:glass-build-surface]?","5"

Since our communities have a ***lot*** in common with all of the 3D printing I know takes place in the model aircraft and drone flying hobbies, I'm hoping to be able to convince some 3DPrinting.Meta users to commit to our proposal.

As I mention in [this Area51.Meta post][3]:

Basically, every printer consists of a frame with some sort of guide rails moving a carriage. On this carriage a build surface is attached where the printer prints the print on. Note that this can be e.g. a moving Y-axis or moving Z-axis carriage. Between the carriage and the build surface you can have multiple elements: a structure or structures, a plate, plates or matts, insulation, etc. This whole set, assembly of elements make up the build platform, an example is shown below.

Note that the linear support can be mounted in Y or Z direction. To tag the elements that make up the build platform assembly, a proposed solution can consist of the following terminology:

 - [tag:z-axis] or [tag:y-axis] in combination with [tag:carriage], 
 - [tag:platform] (to support printers that have a solid platform, e.g. Hyrel)
 - [tag:heated-bed] (aluminium bed or a silicone matt)

Basically, every printer consists of a frame with some sort of guide rails<sup>1</sup> moving a carriage. On this carriage a build surface is attached where the printer prints the print on; it is always the top of the stack. Note that this can be e.g. a moving Y-axis<sup>2</sup> or moving Z-axis carriage<sup>3</sup>. In some cases the carriage is missing and there is just a static mounting, then it's a platform instead<sup>4</sup>. It is basically irrelevant if the build surface is glued to the stack or removeable in some way or another.

Between the carriage and the build surface you can have have a stack of multiple elements: a structure or structures, a plate, plates or matts, insulation, etc. This **whole** assembly of elements make up the build platform, an example is shown below.

[![Proposed build platform terminology][1]][1]

Note that the linear support can be mounted in Y or Z direction. To tag the elements that make up the *build platform assembly*, a proposed solution can consist of the following terms for subassemblies:

 - [tag:z-axis] or [tag:y-axis] in combination with [tag:carriage], 
 - [tag:platform] (to support printers that have a solid platform, e.g. Hyrel/Delta)
 - [tag:heated-bed] (aluminium bed or a silicone matt), which can have a 
 - [tag:glass-print-surface], [tag:pei-print-surface], [tag:buildtak-print-surface], etc. possibly augmented with the additional tag of [tag:removeable-print-surface] or [tag:magnetic-print-surface].

## Annotations

 1. The rails often take the shape of rods and bearings, linear rails
    of V-slot profile.
 2. Carthesian Portal or Cantilever printers 
 3. CoreXY like the Hypercube  
 4. Delta Printers

SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta. 

I think that you *should* ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-) 

Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, *you* think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).

If it **does** end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.

I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have *bad post days* sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)

Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind. Often, I have found, whilst writing and clarifying a question, that I had actually mis-understood the whole issue in the first place, and sometimes re-working a post can help me find my own solution (especially when using peoples comments to adjust the original post), or at the very least, help me get my head around the issue.

### TL;DR - Don't over think this, just post your question :-)

> [![Featured tag removal][2]][2]

For the post in question the [tag:featured] tag was added Aug 3 and by Sept 9 it was deleted, by Community. This post, https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/281797/when-and-why-is-the-featured-tag-removed-by-the-community-user, states that they are removed after 30 (or so) days:

> if we did not, every meta would be littered with dozens of forgotten ""featured"" questions over time.

Also, I can't seem to get it to work, I've just featured the [On-topic meta question][3], but it doesn't seem to show up anywhere in a ""Featured"" box. Neither on 3D printing meta nor the main 3D printing site.

### Update

It seems as if there is a little delay, at most 5-6 hours (I've tested it), between adding the featured flag and it appearing in a box:

> [![Featured on meta][4]][4]

It also appears to hang around in the box for another 12- 14 hours *after* the tag has been removed.

***One thing that I did see was that the closed questions, also seem to get automatically deleted. This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers. So this raises the question that whilst, yeah, close the obvious shopping answers, should the associated information/knowledge that resides in the answers be lost, or not displayed, because the question was auto-deleted? Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?***

---

### Preamble

*Admittedly, this is a bit of a slippery slope, and I certainly am **not** advocating that all closed questions get re-opened but I was going through [some of] the closed questions last night and it is a shame that a few were closed due to the narrow (maybe strict?) guide lines that were set initially. If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276, for new topics pulled from some select closed questions.*

### Beachcombing the closed question pile

I have been browsing a number of [closed questions][1] and came across a lot of ""Best first printer"" type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing *all* of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it *has already* been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.

Taking this one as an example, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.

Since having been closed, it has now been *automatically deleted*. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?

I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of *closed-but-don't-delete* flag? 

If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of ""Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?"" or ""It's a shopping question!""

Regardless, it *does* seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.

### Summing up

So, the point of this post is, should we save this information somewhere, and if so, in what format? I envisage a number of possibilities:

 - Blog post
 - [Locked question][2]
 - [Protected question][3]
 - [Featured tagged question][4]<sup>1</sup>   (meta only?)
 - [FAQ tagged question][5]<sup>1</sup> (meta only?)
 - Closed, but not deleted, question - if this is possible
 - A community wiki type post

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

### Update

The list below was integrated into the on-topics page, on the 8<sup>th</sup> June 2019. See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally for *further* discussion.

That's almost **40%** of our content ripe for reputation. That equates to **8,565 reputation** points just by purely accepting one of the available answers.

I've periodically used the link above to retroactively remind users that they can approve of an answer. There's nothing wrong with reminding users in the comments, so long as it is asked appropriately. If you don't know how to word it, feel free to steal my wording from the post above.

Similarly, there was [another answer][2] to another question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5869/danger-in-3d-printing-over-a-lithium-ion-battery/, that raised some eyebrows over its possible dangerous outcome.

and there the video clip is inlined:

----- 

### TL;DR

Is video inlining disabled on SE.3D Printing, or is it because we are still beta?

If it can be enabled , then should/could it be enabled? 

I personally think it would be useful to enable it, and save a few mouse clicks (and RSI) having to open the video in another tab/window etc. What do other people think?

The print-material tag clearly states that it is different from material:

> Print-material, in comparison to the tag 'material', helps to specify that the question is concerned with the material the print itself is made from. This includes 'filament' as a subgroup but also SLS polymers for example.

Where as [tag:material] states, more or less, the same thing:

> For questions about compatible 3D printing materials.
>
> For questions regarding 3D printable materials such as whether a material is capable of being 3D printed, optimal 3D printing parameters (ie. extrusion temp), mechanical properties of materials, etc.

To me, even though [tag:print-material] states that it differs from [tag:material], I can't really see the difference, *unless* material is a superset of print-material, and not only confined to being printed, but also construction of a printer (i.e. acrylic, wood, steel, aluminium, etc.). If the latter, then the description of [tag:material] is a bit misleading and may require expansion.

**Why include:**

There are multiple questions about 3D printing that also could be asked in the electrical and mechanical engineering sites, as well as the robotics site. However, since most 3D printers basically are desktop robots, all of these topics will eventually be relevant.

An example format might be: 

# How do I repair {X} #

> I've tried {a[]} to fix {X}, but {b[]} occurred. What are some other common means of fixing {X}?

Most of what is acceptable on SE is troubleshooting and I feel that repairing is a subset of troubleshooting. In other words, typically you'll result in repairing from troubleshooting, but [hopefully] not the other way around. So, a repair question is essentially requiring, upfront, what a great quality answer would provide in some troubleshooting questions.

For example:

# {X} wont work #
> {X} isn't working, what could be the cause?

could lead to:

> I've encountered {X} as a result of {Y}. I was able to fix it by performing {C}.

Where **{C}** is typically going above and beyond the OP's question.

I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.

# Search Engines #
Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.

So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.

Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:

***Extruder keeps jamming*** as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.

***MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament*** as a question title is more specific and contains more ""keywords"" that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.

# Etiquette #
I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to ""advertise"" the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend ""advertising"" the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.

If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.

 - Machine Manufacturer
 - Machine Model
 - Preferred Slicing software

Then, a flair-like control can be added to any questions that they ask?

I typed in a quick example of how it might look with our current flair:

[![enter image description here][1]][1]

Here's a snippet of the HTML, I just placed it under the `<div class=""user-details""></div>` control in the flair control:

    <div>
      Runs a <span id=""user-Manufacturer"">MakerBot</span> <span id=""user-Model"">Replicator Dual</span> using <span id=""user-Slicer"">MakerWare</span>
    </div>

Just a thought for a potential mod here in the community.


**Side note:** The same concept could be applied to other sites as well. Ie, StackOverflow could have preferred language(s) and/or IDE(s).

----------

## What should our documentation contain?

Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from [the Definition phase of Area 51][2].

But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.

Take the [Super User ""About"" page][3] as an example:

>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.
>
>Ask about...
>
> * Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking
> * Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered
>
>Don't ask about...
>
> * Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware
> * Questions that are primarily opinion-based
> * Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer
> * Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer
> * Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress
> * Shopping, buying or product recommendations
> * Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks

These are then elaborated on in SU's [What topics can I ask about here?][4] page.

It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues **specific to your topic and your community**.

# 1.

Often, what we do is you have a canonical ""catch-all"" question.

Since the shopping questions seem to have been deemed off-topic, this is probably your best bet. What you need to do is to guide users to select a printer themselves, but by asking them a set of criteria. Therefore, you would need an answer that addresses the following questions (but in no way limited to the following):

- What filament do I choose?
- What's my budget?
- What size do I need?

... etc. 

With such a post, you guide users to what they want, and then in the end, you can recommend a few printers.

Also, this question has to be locked using what's known as a wiki-lock. This way, the community can edit the question to update it, and it prevents spam and other nonsensical answers.

# 2.

You close them as off-topic.

Since this seems to be a persistent problem, it would be helpful to add a custom close reason (hey mods! That's for you!). Something along the lines of this would be good:

> Questions asking for the recommendation of a printer or other 3D printing-related resource are off-topic because they tend to attract opinion-based questions, low-quality answers, and spam. For more information, see [Why are recommendations off-topic and where can I ask?](link to a meta post)

You get the community to get support for the close reason, and a moderator implements it to allow questions to be closed. Bingo!

However, you're going to need a meta post explaining why they are off-topic as well as other information. That's good etiquette: you don't leave users stranded and you continue to guide them to where they can ask a question.

# 3.

You do 1. first.

Then, you allow such ""shopping"" questions to be on-topic, as long as they follow the specific criteria and answer all the questions that you have outlined in the meta post. Otherwise, you close it.

Numerous sites do this. On Open Source, we allow questions that ask for the recommendation of an open source license. We have a meta post on what you need to include, as well as a dedicated close reason in case something is not of quality. It works very well.

The only downside, is that it can take a bit of time and work to get right.","5"

>Tbm0115 - ""support-material"" should define the material-type (ie. PLA, ABS, PVA, etc.) which in FDM is usually the same as the print-material. However, in the case of machines like dual-extruders can be completely different. The print-material for the body of the part can be PLA while the support-material can be PVA. 
>
>Support-structure defines the ""style"" of structure that is generated by the slicer. For instance, I can have a scaffolding-like structure to support bridges and spire-like structure for small overhangs. Personally, I view infill as a subset of support-structure because it is material that is meant to support the overall body including ceilings. With infill I can have square, hexagonal, even cat-like styles of support structure.
>
>Trish - I agree on the structure being more about style (Trees, pylons, towers, included in the design or not, everywhere or not) while support material is more a subset of filament - PVA is one of those, but also one could use (in a dual extruder) ABS on a PLA print, and then remove the supports with acetone or some other stuff. One might use a super low melting filament and remove with heat.","5"

A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:

While there certainly are [Moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) here, a significant amount of the *moderation* is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.
   
As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together.

So they don't seem ***exactly*** the same. I dunno, I'm not sure. However, we apparently have the tags already, so that isn't a major issue anymore. 

With regards to the synonym aspect: Are the questions going to to be the same, i.e. will the same issues happen to both TPU and TPE, or will TPU have special, particular issues? If the latter, then a synonym maybe isn't a good idea.

Regarding [tag:flexible], I wonder if it is necessary. Aren't we trying to reduce the number of filament tags? See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/59/fixing-the-filament-tags. If having [tag:flexible] will help in this direction then all well and good, otherwise, maybe it isn't.

However, I'm not a filament expert. You can decide what you want to do and if you need me to do it, message me in chat or leave a comment.

The second answer to that question more or less states that if the user isn't asking how to download or hack, but just has a basic issue with the software, which *a licensed user would also encounter*, then it isn't a problem... apparently.

As we learn and grow our own knowledge, things we once considered hard become easy.

Now, our answers often address issues that are *pretty easy* to fix by tweaking **simple things** like...

* leveling the bed
* fixing the settings in the slicer 
* [replacing a broken endstop for a new part][1]
* [correct replacement nozzle][2]
* pretty 2/3rd of the questions in [tag:Troubleshooting]

At other times, we clearly go into **advanced** repairs and fixes, for example:

* [flashing firmware][3]
* [small alterations of the firmware][4]
* [installing new capabilities to a printer][5]
* most of the remaining 1/3rd of [tag:troubleshooting], usually for the points above

And then there are at times rather **complicated** things, for example:

* [sifting through the firmware to find when one function is actually called][6]
* the remaining [tag:troubleshooting] turns out the be this, because of the oddity of the problem.

## Call
Let us make a rough guideline what rough level of expertise we expect from a common user and how to address the required level of details in answers!

So First Posts and Late Answers are always at the bottom (requiring 500 reputation on graduated sites and 350 on beta sites like 3D Printing). On beta sites, Close Votes and Reopen Votes are next (at 500 reputation), followed by Low Quality Posts and Suggested Edits (1000 reputation) at the top. On graduated sites, it's the other way around: Low Quality Posts and Suggested Edits at 2000 reputation, and Close Votes and Reopen Votes at 3000 reputation.

Or, as [Shog9 put it](https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/346651/4751173):

> They're ordered *first* by the minimum reputation needed to access the queue, and *then* alphabetically by the name of the queue.

> The purpose of this ordering is to keep the list as consistent as possible *until your privilege-level changes* - the hope is that folks use this as their primary means of accessing the queues, and as such we're not forcing reviewers to override their muscle-memory every time they go to access a specific queue - a worthy design goal for a menu that appears on just about every page of the site.

I am still a low-reputation of SE, with most of my involvement being here.  I know that each SE has it's own personality, somewhat derived from the charter, somewhat from the written standards, and somewhat determined by the customary practices in the community.

I have found from reading many answers that the first line is often ""soft"".  A welcome to a new user.  A word of appreciation for the question.  A social throat-clearing before jumping into the substance of the answer.  Over time, I have adopted this form myself, especially with a user who is new to 3D Printing SE.

Three days ago, one of my answers was edited to remove the preliminary social lubricant.  I'm fine with this, and I understand it is in keeping with the position that the value of SE to the investors is in the responsive content of the answers, not in the social glue.  I would have approved the edits myself except that one can not do that from the app.  Today, I connected through a desktop and found that the edit had been auto-approved.  Again, no problem.

But to the question.

We want to be welcoming to new users, and we hope they will stay close to the site and become active members.  To do so requires communication, the informal, person-to-person communication that builds oxytocin rather than facts.  This doesn't fit the business purpose of SE, but it is necessary to support the mission of SE which must succeed for the business to succeed.

Is the right method to:

 1. Welcome people in an answer,
 2. Welcome people in a comment, where it is also not appropriate,
 3. Do not welcome people -- just stick to the facts, or
 4. Welcome people in an answer but bo back later and strip it out?

As the community of regular and active members is limited, I think it is okay to welcome people in a comment or an answer. It would be a shame to scare people away after their first question, resulting in abandoned questions and unaccepted answers. But, we do need to conform to the Q&A format and sometimes need to remind people this isn't a forum of threaded messages and we do have some rules to participate. We have created some [standard comments](/q/303/) that welcome and thank new members but at the same time lead them to the rules of the site.

It might be a good idea to approach first time (SE) members friendly. Welcoming comments can and tend to be deleted after a while when users aren't new anymore (everybody can raise a flag on a comment to vote for *”It's no longer needed""*). So option 4 would be my preferred option.

Personally I think this site is more welcoming than larger sites as SO for instance. My first experiences at SO didn't make me feel welcome.","2"

TBH, while it was a nice gesture to a new user, I think that the welcome was (sort of) out of place in the answer, purely because the welcome would age away with time, whereas the technical meat of the answer wouldn't... If that makes sense.

Sorry, I don't have time to post a longer answer, at the moment, but I'd say put the ""welcome"" in a ethereal comment, which can easily be cleaned up later, and keep the answers to be just that: technical info.","2"

 - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;
 - Replace slang with grammatical English;
 - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. 
 - Remove instances of ""EDIT:"" and the such like. There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.

### Text formatting

 - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `<br>`) when there is a markdown equivalent;
 - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;
 - Quote formatting;

### Images

 - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags;
 - Clickable image display;
 - Orientation of image - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor
 - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor
 - Ensure that the image has been added to the Stack Exchange imgur, rather than an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][3].

### Inlining links

 - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;
 - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.

### Title

 - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;
 - Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. ""This Is Very Ugly To Deal With"";
 - Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title.

There are many more examples, so this list may get updated from time to time.

I wrote this post as one central post doesn't seem to exist. There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main [SE.Meta][4] site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to. However, generally, it is by looking at other people's edits (across the various SE sites), that one gets an idea as to what should be fixed.

 - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. 
 - Remove instances of ""EDIT:"" and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.

### Text formatting

 - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `<br>`) when there is a markdown equivalent;
 - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;
 - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.
 - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).

### Images

 - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags;
 - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![<imagedescription>][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the ""outside"" wrapper brackets get lost;
 - Orientation of image - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][3].

### Inlining links

 - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;
 - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.

### Title

 - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;

Where do we draw the line in the sand? [This was once discussed in 2016, but no conclusive answer defined.][1]

* Any CAD question should show **how** or **why** they are related to 3D printing, otherwise it is out of scope.
  * Examples: ""How to cut up a model for 3D printing"" is **in** for showing relatedness
  * ""How to do a plane Cut on a model in FreeCAD?"" is **out** for not showing relatedness
* Questions about functions of a program are out of scope unless they show how they are related to 3D printing.
  * Example: ""How to combine two bodies in Fusion360"" is **out** unless showing how it relates to printing
  * The same question showing relatedness: ""I want to print a mashup model of this and this STEP file. I need them as a single STL. How to do that in Fusion 360?""
* **Bug reports are always out of scope.** We are not the bugtracker.

The opinion based, the open ended and and the *list of questions in one question*. Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasing [earlier][1].

But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!

1. ""I want to buy X. Where to get it?""
2. ""I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?""
3. ""I wonder about X. Has anyone encountered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?""

All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concerning one:

Question 2 is more a ""LMGTFY"". There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.

Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass<sup>donkey</sup>. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a separate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as: 

 1. All affiliations are made clear [e.g. is it a bought machine, review/send back machine or review/keep machine? Who's the sponsor? Just a watcher of this and that channel that reviewed the machine?] 
 2. They pass a Quality Control (however that may look like - guidelines are still to be made)
 3. **They are not link-only answers.** One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.

Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are *some* fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (""Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?"") And there are questions that are what the RPG-Stack-Exchange calls ""Shopping & Recommendation"". They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these ""locate a real world place that does X"" cases. IMHO we shouldn't  answer to a question like ""What is a good first printer?"" or ""Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?"" or others of these kind. Maybe the fringe case of ""Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?"" is ok too (as it is very specific!), but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.


So, in fleshing out our community:

**Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?**

It *was* added to the [What's on topic meta question][1], but that area of the topic list doesn't seem to have been particularly well hammered out. If you look at the [What's on topic help page][2], it does state:

> Blender - whilst there may be some overlap with [SE.Blender][3], **if the question is related to 3D printing then it is on-topic**

Maybe the whole line needs re-wording to be less Blender centric..?

Regarding the question that caused this issue to be raised again, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/15335/how-to-combine-difference-with-concatinate-object, I must admit that initially I agreed with [Mick's comment][4] that it was probably on-topic. However, following [your comment][5], I wholeheartedly agree that any CAD question *really should* have some 3D printing element attached, in order for it to fit on this site (as the On-topic help page implies).

So, in short, you are indeed correct, and backed up by the what's on-topic help page. 

In addition, the on-topic help page needs a slight clarification, such as:

> If a CAD question is related to 3D printing then it is on-topic. However, general CAD questions, if there is not a 3D printing angle, are not on-topic. Likewise, with Blender - whilst there may be some overlap with [SE.Blender][3], if the question is related to to 3D printing then it is on-topic.

Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...

Following on from tjb1's meta post, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?

So, with respect to our [On-topic page][1], which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (""why has my question been closed?""/""why is X not allowed""),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words ""[ask][2]"" and ""[topic][3]"". I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked. 

A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.

Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read *every* question and answer listed below fully - *there may be some suggestions that I have missed*. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).

Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more *inclusive*.

BTW, a useful post to read is [What should our documentation contain?][4]

Any thoughts, questions, additional suggestions that have not already been posted, agreements, or disagreements?

### Update

The list below was integrated into the on-topics page, on the 8<sup>th</sup> June 2019. See https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally for *further* discussion.

[on-topic page][1] has been fixed up and made to look like the on-topic pages of other SE sites, rather than a jumbled beta mess (which was entirely my fault after my previous patch, I must admit). As we aren't really a *beta*-beta site any more (but rather more one of those perpetual beta sites) it seemed sensible to tidy it up.

Also, a recent [CAD question][2] raised some issues with the on-topic page, for not being particularly clear.

Obviously, it can still change a bit, and any suggestions or corrections will be *whole-heartedly* welcomed.

Personally, I feel that the off-topic section doesn't seem prominent enough to me, but it has the same ""format"" as the other sites have. However, the other sites don't have such a massive list of on-topic as us - their on- and off-topic sections are *roughly* the same size, whereas our off-topic section is about 5 % the size of our on-topic section. Hence why the off-topic section seems to be invisible, stuck down right at the bottom.

Also, the only weird bit left now is the large block of waffly `<sub></sub>` text. Firstly, links don't seem to work within that block, for some reason, so I stripped them out. Secondly, some of the waffle needs to go.

Apart from that... ""Mission Accomplished""?

Apologies to all that it took so long to fix up and prettify.

As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=""year+in+moderation""+is%3Aquestion).

As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

> We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  
> -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)

That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.

So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg). Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:

 - Questions per day
 - <strike>Users vs Reputation</strike>
 - <strike>Visits per day</strike>

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

It is worth noting that tbm0115's [post][1] was roughly *six months ago* - since then *all* of the stats have got *even* worse, with the exception of users vs rep. The worst stat, by far, is **visits/day** which is apparently only 4!?!? That can't be right, surely? 

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

<sup>*</sup> This change in the number of users with *X* reputation is, in part, due to the move from +5 to +10 reputation for upvoted questions.

###Additional points of note

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

###The final hurdle

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.

Additional points of note
---

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

The final hurdle
---

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. 

### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...

Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please see [Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!][7].

As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=""year+in+moderation""+is%3Aquestion).

As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

> We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  
> -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)

That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.

So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg). Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:

When this happens, we delete the answer but also leave a comment asking the new user to post their own question:

> Hi and welcome to SE.3DP! Unfortunately, your answer does not answer the question. Without wishing to sound harsh, StackExchange is a Q&A site, and not a forum of threaded messages. The reason for this is to aid the search for answers to issues, and provide it in a structured Q&A way. I know that this might seem a pain, but can you repost your question using the Ask Question link at the top of the page? When you repost your new question, please feel free to refer back to this original question using the URL, seeing as it is the reason why you posted in the first place

However, they don't seem to ever re-post their query as a question.

So, my point is, should we:

1. Convert the answer into a comment so that someone can answer them (totally against SE policy);
2. Leave the answer as is, or;
3. Continue deleting and leaving the standard comment.

Points 1 and 2 are both against SE policy, and would turn the Q&A format into a forum of threaded messages, so point 3 would be the correct ""SE way"" of doing things. However, it does also mean that these new users:

1. Don't get any help, and;
2. Seem to get scared off.

Any ideas how to fix this? Or am I worrying too much?

I guess a user with enough rep could (if they know the answer), briefly undelete the answer, leave a comment as to provide a solution, and then re-delete it. However, this is a double edged sword: this wouldn't encourage the new user to post their own question, although it would give them the help that they need. Also, not only does it encourage bad SE etiquette, we probably don't have enough users with sufficient rep to do this.

Another way of looking at it is that, if the new user *really* needs help then they *will* post their own question, and if they don't post one, then they weren't all that desperate.

Many questions are actually [troubleshooting questions](/q/83/). You may try to answer them to unblock the concerned who stuck, but number of possible causes, which mean many degrees of freedom... so sometimes you can only guess. Also about skills of the asking person (sign me up). Definitely nothing to complain about, there is learning curve and its laws. But these guess-answers will often lead to:
* opening an discussion in comments, not very promising because of limited and not-so-interactive nature of comments,
* abandoning the question by dishartened user, who may find it too hard, misleading, or even [not answering the question](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/answers-that-dont-answer-the-question).

So:
1) **Should we propose a chat** to discuss doubts and do troubleshooting, when comments start growing? Is it accepted practice in the process? Is it good in your opinion?

2) Troubleshooting is very specific and rather short-living discussion. **What chat room to use the best?** I suppose that creating new room for each issue should be avoided. So far I could not learn the real nature of [Public 3D Printing Room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room) (yet?), but to me it seems proper for higher-level subjects (of some wider use, for community, etc.).

   So maybe it would be better to have a separate chat(s) for ad hoc troubleshooting. Maybe to revitalize [The Hotbed](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/the-hotbed-3d-printing) for such purpose? This name even sounds appropriate for all the urgency and surgery ;)

3) If the question contesnts sounds more like panic button press, rather than effect of understanding to the reasonable limints with concious research, should we propose **switching to chat immediately** instead of throwing hints and discouraging prompts? I am aware that few of us is going to assist for longer period, but still it more transparent and better then in comments, and there is a change for more people to join in and even take over the subject. Great chance to mix skills and specialities, instead of trying to offer half-answers.

4) More interactive approach would lead to more successful answers. This will help growing this community by having **more users coming back**, with increasing awareness - I suppose this is key factor. It's easier to summarize results of colloquial chat as a question improvement or as an answer, than write literary paragraph with all possibly important details (and they you have to read all of it back and forth). It would be also more convenient to remind of accepting answers or even voting due to gratitude - which made in comments seems to have an opposite effect (sometimes like admonishing; lifeless automated reminders work much better for such reasons).

This is a separate chat between the discussing users, but not limited, I've entered many of those rooms later to pitch in. The generic [Public 3D Printing Room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room) can be used for any 3D related problem, discussion or a friendly hang-out chat.

Chat requires a 20 reputation. [Hence the voting is key](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote), this is what is killing us, too less people feel the urge to put in a vote. Currently we have only [15 users](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=all) that have voted more than 500 times. Special [badges](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges) (Moderation Badges) are to be earned, e.g.
- [Civic Duty] -> Vote 300 or more times (awarded only 18 times to date!)
- [Electorate] -> Vote on 600 questions and 25% or more of total votes are on questions (awarded only 7 times to date!)
- [Vox Populi] -> Use the maximum 40 votes in a day (awarded only 29 times to date!)

If the question is from a new user and half decent we should vote up to reward the question so that the user is able to enter the chat. Similar for answers, I've seen answers that are good but still not receive the votes and attention the answer should receive. Voting doesn't cost anything. If you don't agree with an answer, you could also withhold your vote and only down vote if something is completely wrong.

 - Questions per day
 - <strike>Users vs Reputation</strike>
 - <strike>Visits per day</strike>

Once those reach the required levels then that should be it. So, there is quite a way to go...

The stats can be seen here, [3D Printing Area51 site][2]:

<sup>*</sup> This change in the number of users with *X* reputation is, in part, due to the move from +5 to +10 reputation for upvoted questions.

------

Additional points of note
---

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

The final hurdle
---

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. 

### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...

Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please see [Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!][7].

I left a comment linking to the Gcode list on the site for Marlin firmware as a further resource.

The author, a moderator, responded:

> It would be better to point people to the [RepRap G-code reference](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code), this site is not firmware specific but targets more firmware flavors.

But that confused me. I don't see any meta question outlining a 3DPSE policy that it is not firmware specific.

I thought answers should be as relevant to the question as possible on the stack exchange network. The OP of the question flagged it for a Creality Ender 3, which uses Marlin, so why is it not better to refer to a Marlin site?

After all, RepRap, while it does use the same Gcode as Marlin, is a specific firmware. If we do have a policy of always linking to neutral Gcode references, wouldn't it be better to link to something like the [wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) entry for Gcode?

So I'm looking for clarification on site policy/best practices.

>I thought answers should be as relevant to the question as possible on the stack exchange network

True, I've asked the OP for the firmware running on the printer, then we know for sure. We could even reference to the [Marlin sources](https://github.com/MarlinFirmware/Marlin/blob/2.0.x/Marlin/src/gcode/motion/G0_G1.cpp) to show that the `G0` and `G1` are exactly the same.

Thanks for reminding that sometimes it is better to further question the OP in comments to make the problem more clear so that the answers can be written as relevant as possible. Sometimes it is easy to answer while it is better to make the question more clear.","5"

I left a comment linking to the G-code list on the site for Marlin firmware as a further resource.

The author, a moderator, responded:

> It would be better to point people to the [RepRap G-code reference](https://reprap.org/wiki/G-code), this site is not firmware specific but targets more firmware flavors.

But that confused me. I don't see any meta question outlining a 3DPSE policy that it is not firmware specific.

I thought answers should be as relevant to the question as possible on the stack exchange network. The OP of the question flagged it for a Creality Ender 3, which uses Marlin, so why is it not better to refer to a Marlin site?

After all, RepRap, while it does use the same G-code as Marlin, is a specific firmware. If we do have a policy of always linking to neutral G-code references, wouldn't it be better to link to something like the [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/G-code) entry for G-code?

So I'm looking for clarification on site policy/best practices.

<sup>*</sup> This change in the number of users with *X* reputation is, in part, due to the move from +5 to +10 reputation for upvoted questions.

------

Additional points of note
---

The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, [in this answer][3], to [“Graduation” of this Community][4]:

 1. A number of 10k+ users ( *n* > 3 ) are required to access mod tools
 2. A number of 3k+ users ( *n* > 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote

The final hurdle
---

The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, [Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!][5], is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link ([Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites][6]) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:

> When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation. 

### No graduation, but losing the Beta label...

Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please see [Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!][7].

We are a smallish site, with a smallish number of active users (although it isn't *that* small, and is slowly growing over time, it should be noted). We don't have a problem with review queues building up *except* with the close votes. Some questions do seem to hang around for a while in the close queue. 

The problem with the close vote review queue requiring 5 votes when there is a *limited* number of active reviewers (where two of which are moderators) is this: If a moderator votes, then the question is automatically closed, even if there aren't 5 votes - if a moderator casts the first vote to close then the question is closed straight away, without waiting for another four votes - so the vote is not democratic, but instead, dictatorial in nature. As such, moderators tend to not vote, unless the question blatantly needs closing (i.e. spam, vulgarity, etc.). 

There are ways around this problem:

 - sock puppets (moderators have a fake account to cast votes only in the review queue), or;
 - waiting for four votes and then a moderator casting the fifth vote (or waiting for three votes and then moderators agreeing (behind the scenes) to cast the final two votes, etc.)

However, these aren't ideal, and just shortening the queue might make things better. This need not be a permanent change, I guess, so if this site, for some reason, eventually exploded in popularity, the review queue *could* go back to five votes (but I'm not 100 % sure about that, see the SE.Meta post above to check).

So... should SE.3DP jump on the ""three votes to close"" train? Or are things OK as they are? What do other users think? *Please* leave a comment or answer. 

To make things super simple, and if you don't have time to write a comment or answer, you can just vote on the **Yes* answer or the **No** answer.

[Direct Ink Writing](https://labs.wsu.edu/mpml/projects/):
> Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW) is an extrusion-based additive manufacturing method heavily utilized in meso- and micro-scales. In DIW, the liquid-phase “ink” is dispensed out of small nozzles under controlled flow rates and deposited along digitally defined paths to fabricate 3D structures layer-by-layer.

[Melt Electro-Writing](https://www.advancedsciencenews.com/melt-electrowriting-where-are-we-now/)
> MEW utilizes an electric field uniquely coupled with AM technology for the controlled deposition of a molten polymer jet, which rapidly solidifies into a fiber. These submicron fibers can be consistently laid on top of each other,  resulting in the ability to direct-write complex and multi-scaled architectures and structures, and overcoming the resolution challenge that a majority of other additive manufacturing technologies encounter.

My request to have these additive manufacturing techniques added to the list of on-topic subjects is driven by the facts that:

1. These are valid Additive Manufacturing processes; and

2. The company for which I work, [Hyrel 3D](http://hyrel3d.com), has customers (mostly at universities) using these processes.","5"

We are a smallish site, with a smallish number of active users (although it isn't *that* small, and is slowly growing over time, it should be noted). We don't have a problem with review queues building up *except* with the close votes. Some questions do seem to hang around for a while in the close queue. 

The problem with the close vote review queue requiring 5 votes when there is a *limited* number of active reviewers (where two of which are moderators) is this: If a moderator votes, then the question is automatically closed, even if there aren't 5 votes - if a moderator casts the first vote to close then the question is closed straight away, without waiting for another four votes - so the vote is not democratic, but instead, dictatorial in nature. As such, moderators tend to not vote, unless the question blatantly needs closing (i.e. spam, vulgarity, etc.). 

There are ways around this problem:

 - sock puppets (moderators have a fake account to cast votes only in the review queue), or;
 - waiting for four votes and then a moderator casting the fifth vote (or waiting for three votes and then moderators agreeing (behind the scenes) to cast the final two votes, etc.)

However, these aren't ideal, and just shortening the queue might make things better. This need not be a permanent change, I guess, so if this site, for some reason, eventually exploded in popularity, the review queue *could* go back to five votes (but I'm not 100 % sure about that, see the SE.Meta post above to check).

So... should SE.3DP jump on the ""three votes to close"" train? Or are things OK as they are? What do other users think? *Please* leave a comment or answer. 

To make things super simple, and if you don't have time to write a comment or answer, you can just vote on the **Yes** answer or the **No** answer.


### End of voting date

To give this vote an end point, and not make it so opened-ended, I guess we should tally a ""final"" vote on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2021 - which is May 6 (trial start date) plus 45 days (length of trial) plus a little bit more. As we can't join the trial halfway through, there isn't much point to tallying up the votes before that.

At that point Catija will be sent the results.

There have to be answer to award the bounty, in this particular case there aren't any answers, so no bounty can be rewarded. The messages you receive are the standard messages. You cannot select an answer, nor can the system. If the deleted answer hadn't been deleted, the negative score would have prevented from being selected by the system as it needs a 2+ vote for automatic rewarding.

Basically, you cannot do anything. You could consider removing (deleting) the question, this is a very particular / intermittent failure that is very difficult to troubleshoot. You might find the solution yourself one day!","2"

From [this answer](https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/298341/) on Meta Stack Exchange question ""[What's the process to change a site logo?](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/298338/whats-the-process-to-change-a-site-logo)"" we can read:

> If you have an issue with a logo on a site, the best place to start is to open a discussion on that site's meta. Tag it [tag:discussion] and [tag:design], and see what the overall community feeling is.

Another part reads:

> [Community managers](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/99338/who-are-the-community-team-and-what-do-they-do) monitor per-site metas, so if/when the discussion concludes and the site's community largely supports a change, they can bring your concerns to the design team.

There is no specific mention if Beta state sites can modify the logo, Beta sites share the smae layout set out by the Stack Exchange designers:

> Our designers come up with the overall site design (including the logo), with some input from the communities. (With the exception of sites that are still in beta or have only recently graduated - those all share the same design.)

However, we can start a discussion whether we would like to have a different logo/favicon. Feel free to add your thoughts ans an aswer to the question.","2"

However... whilst it is obvious (to most people) which flags apply to which answers - when those answers are really just comments and those answers that are just gibberish - I've never totally and fully understood the subtle difference between **Not an answer** and **Low quality answer**, with respect to the queues and the flags that the moderators see. This following post goes some way to explaining the difference. 

*This is copied verbatim from [Please don't flag link-only answers as Very Low Quality][1]*

The downside is that there is no predefined synonym to choose from! (drop-down list)

E.g. if you make a synonym tag [tag:frankensbox-fx-800] for the target tag [tag:dedibot-df3], the user creating the tag to the question needs to be exactly typed in as `frankensbox-fx-800`, i.e. there is no pop-up for suggestions of the tag you are about to use. So, when the OP enters `fx800frankensbox` or `frankensbox-fx800` this might not work, and the user is not presented with the `frankensbox-fx-800` option...","2"

If you thought, as I did, that the **Recommend Deletion** button, in the **Late Answers** review, deletes posts... well, it doesn't.

***If an answer merits deletion***, then, in addition to selecting the **Recommend Deletion** radio button, also raise a flag against the answer, before hitting submit.

Actually, you *could* also raise the flag *after* hitting submit, it doesn't really matter... basically, just make sure that you raise a flag.

I saw this, [Recommend Deletion option in Late Answers review queue does nothing - please flag posts that should be deleted][1].

The actual bug has ben raised on Meta, [Remove (or rename) the ineffective ""recommend deletion"" option from Late Answers queue][2].

## What is Beta?
As the (somewhat out of date) [Help Center article](https://meta.stackexchange.com/help/whats-beta) says:

“Beta” means that the site is still being defined and constructed.

We as a community have done pretty well at this. We've got over 5000 visits per day of which 2000 are new visitors. In the meta post https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/264/what-does-it-take-to-get-out-of-beta-stage we've tried to explain the progress on the Beta stage. Apart from the minimum questions per day (10 questions per day metric) we're doing quite well for the classic criteria for graduation (note that the smaller SE sites have difficulties to comply to this requirement).

We've got a good understanding of what's [on-topic and what's not](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic).
Most of our tags have detailed tag wiki excerpts, explaining how and why they should be used.
Us Pro-Tempore Moderators are doing less work due to our active [users](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users) (thank you!). What we still need to work on is [voting](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&filter=year), see https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote.

## What graduation means
There are several aspects to graduation. These used to be bundled together as an all-or-nothing thing, but they [aren't any more](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303727/lets-break-up-with-graduation-and-remove-a-bunch-of-beta-labels). This means:

 - Losing the beta label (yes! 16th December 2021, give or take)
   - ""Graduated"" on [our Area 51 page](https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing)
   - Removing the “Site Stats” and “Help us grow this site!” boxes shown to anonymous users.
 - Moderator elections (2022 or 2023)
 - Migration paths, maybe, if we ask for them.

But we won't have:

 - Increased reputation thresholds
 - [Custom site design](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-september) (but we might get minor customization)

## How we can prepare

If you think we shouldn't graduate, for whatever reason, please say so: there's still time to slam on the brakes.

Otherwise, we don't really need to do anything. If you want to, though, here are some ideas:

 - Write tag wiki excerpts for every single [tag](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags). I think this is achievable, even for weird tags like [tag:support], [tag:dimensional-accuracy] and [tag:chamber] to name a few.
 - Write some basic ([tag:knowledgebase]) Q&A pairs, or edit/tag existing questions into such. (New-ish users: you're the best for this. If you have had a question about how the site works, chances are it's FAQ-worthy.)
 - Answer some [unanswered questions](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/unanswered) or vote to close if appropriate.
 - Start thinking of questions for our first moderator election. Also consider who you might want to nominate, and whether you might want to nominate yourself.

Lastly, visit our [public 3D printing chat room](https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room) for some on- and off-topic conversations!

As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=""year+in+moderation""+is%3Aquestion).

As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

> We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  
> -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)

That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.

So as we say goodbye to 2021, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZntT.gif). Below is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:

##Printer and basic settings

The most basic problem when we have to help is, that we often don't know what the setup is. So, we need stuff to help in identifying what the user is actually using. But how does the user know? They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:

The layer height I set to 0.[x] mm, the line width [line width/extrusion width] from the 0.[x] mm nozzle. The Printing Speed is set to [x] mm/s [for walls and [x] mm/s for infill].

But the good news is **you now officially only need 3 close votes to close a question on 3D Printing SE!**

After looking at the data, I think it's clear that there's no reason for y'all to have this set at 5. Thank you so much for bearing with us while we got to this request.

We'll check back in with you all in a few months to see how things are going — if things are going great, we may not post an update but please feel free to leave a comment if you want us to post something.

Here's some basic stats of how things look:

Over the last two years, you've had heavy fluctuations in effectiveness, when looking into what percentage of questions that received at least one flag or vote to close actually ended up getting closed. As you can see, the effectiveness is in the 60%~100% range — the good news is that the numbers of posts this represents are relatively small (always under 20 posts per month).

<!-- 28637 -->

[![Graph showing the percentage of handled tasks, as described in the paragraph above][1]][1]

The graph below, however, does show something that is a bit more concerning:

<!-- 28653 -->

[![Graph showing all closed posts, posts closed by the community, and posts closed by the moderation team. The line representing posts closed by the moderation team matches the line of all closed posts on almost all of the reporting period][2]][2]

This shows that the moderation team is doing the bulk of the closing, which can be problematic because the mods shouldn't be making these decisions on their own, even with other users weighing in. To add a bit more nuance, though, it looks like the moderation is not _single-handedly_ closing the posts, but rather stepping in to aid the community on a big chunk of cases — the graph below shows which vote the moderators cast, to close posts:

[![Graph showing the amount of times mods cast the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th vote to close questions on the site][3]][3]

When working on this project, Catija had found two primary use cases for this change:

1. When too many items are going unhandled (not unclosed, just unhandled)
2. When the moderators are doing the bulk of the closing/reopening.

Because the mods here are casting the bulk of the final close votes, the first graph looks good (at least in the months where 100% effectiveness is reached). However, this creates an imbalance between closing and reopening as the mods now have to be really thoughtful about reviewing for reopening.

So, my hope is that changing this to three votes to close/reopen will take some of the workload off the mods and also increase the number of posts that find their way to be reopened - assuming it's worth reopening them!

- Engineering
  - Tag: [CAD][1]
  - Tag: [Solidworks][2]
- Graphic Design
  - Tag: [3D][3]

IMHO, SE.Engineering would seem to be the best location, although it probably depends upon the practical application described by the question. What I mean is, if the design is for a logo of a company, then SE.GraphicDesign is probably a better fit.

There is a SE.Computer Graphics but that would seem to be more for coding and low-level stuff. SE.Mathematics is definitely a ""no"".

### Blender

Obviously, if the question is about Blender then [SE.Blender][4] is a perfect fit. Blender is a special case as it already has a dedicated SE site.

### External sites

Another alternative is Reddit, for example

- [reddit.com/r/Fusion360][5]

However, if the question is purely about how to draw/design something, without it needing to be printed, where can a user ask these questions, if they are off-topic here? That is to say, where can the user be pointed to? Which Stack Exchange site?

As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=""year+in+moderation""+is%3Aquestion).

As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

> We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  
> -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)

That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.

So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gif).

1. Mis-spelt - missing an ""e""
2. No hyphens - shouldn't it be hyphenated, like this: `[automatic-bed-leveling]`?

I don't believe that it should be abreviated, or become an acronym, such as `[abl]`... but maybe I am wrong..?

as it is not only obvious but also adds nothing that the name of the tag doesn't already provide.

---------------------
In digital video, photography, television and film, post-production refers to the tasks that must be completed or executed after the filming or shooting ends. This includes tasks such as the editing of raw footage to cut scenes, insert transition effects, working with voice and sound actors, and dubbing, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks. Post-production is the third and final step in film creation. It follows the pre-production and production phases.

*Note that I found it was rather difficult to formulate an answer to this question, without making it sound negative, opinionated and panic inducing. In fact I decided to remove quite a bit, and just leave in factual links and quotes.*

I came across this meta question over on SO today, [How can we determine whether an answer used ChatGPT?][1], and [this answer][2] in particular grabbed my attention: 

> I don't think there's going to be any value in having ***you***, a mere mortal, try to determine if an answer or question was generated by ChatGPT.
>
> The reason is super, super simple: **we don't want this to turn into a witch hunt**.

> There are things you can do even today to help with curation of answers; if an answer is wrong or incomplete, you can downvote it. If you *happen* to notice a trend of similarly bad answers from an account, you can flag for moderator attention with the series of answers you've got as evidence.
>
> This shouldn't be a ""those bad answers are more moderatable than others"" situation - just vote on answers as you always would, and let the moderators deal with the heavier lifting on this circumstance.

Which raises a valid point of allowing *suspicion and doubt* to get the better of us.

Yes, we have recently seen some questionable posts, and (to be frank) even now I am still not 100% convinced what the *root* cause of those posts were.

Nevertheless, community voting and flagging seem to allow us to handle such situations reasonably well. 

However, one thing that is certain: ChatGPT, and any other derivatives, are not going to go away, and it is probably going to become more and more difficult, as time goes by and the technology ""improves"", to detect such posts.

The tools that you used (and refer to in your question), while I haven't tried them myself, look useful - even though they themselves would *also* appear to be using some sort of artificial decision making! The best tools are probably our own eyes and knowledge to root out suspect sentences and phrasing as well as (more importantly) suspect advice. 

In addition, a couple of answers (to the linked to meta SO question) also point out some good tips and what to look for - such as [this answer][3] and the first paragraph of [this answer][4], in particular.

Unless it is a very specific resource (e.g. ""I need the handbook for printer X"" or ""original Firmware for printer Y""), requests for a general file resource are basically asking ""Recommend me a 3D file site!"". There is no best answer there, so they are recommendation and shopping questions - and off topic on almost all stacks. And [shopping is a nono on the Stack.][1]

Shouldn't this site be called ""3D manufacturing"" or something broader? As 3D printing suggest only ""printing"" and not everything related to 3D printing such as 3D scanning or even 3D designing. I suppose that is off-topic? Is this scope defined somewhere?

Is everything related to (or for the purpose of) 3D printing such as 3D scanning using photogrammetry, NeRF or other techniques as well as 3D designing in-scope on this site?

I think both 3D scanning as well as 3D designing should be on-topic here.

Frequently you'll find that you type similar comments, but depending on inspiration and time, the comments differ. It would be an excellent idea to maintain a standard comments reply list on some sort of platform (GitHub, GitLab, community wiki on meta, etc.).

Each standardised comment below is shown in two formats:

1. As *block quotes* for readability
2. As *code formatting*, for ease of copy and paste (**C&P &#x2398;**)

*Where applicable, replace `<username>` with the actual user name of the poster being addressed*.


Note that an automatic standardized comment already exists for marking a duplicate topic; the system will post a default duplicate comment message for you which you can change within 5 minutes after posting.



There are four sections:

 - [General Comments][8]
 - [Comments][9]
 - [Questions][10]
 - [Answers][11]




## Welcome to Stack Exchange

Please use these in conjunction with other necessary/constructive comments - not as a stand alone comment, as these tend to add *noise*

    Hi <username> and welcome to Stack Exchange!

or 

    Hi <username> and welcome to Stack Exchange 3D Printing!

or shorter (given the limited number of character) and more precise

    Hi <username> and welcome to SE.3DPrinting!

or even shorter

    Hi <username> and welcome to SE.3DP!

### Note on shortcuts: *Magic links* and Relative paths

It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using *shortcuts*. Note that the `[help]`, `[ask]`, `[answer]` and `[about]` tags (in the C&P) expand into *Help Center*, *How to Ask*, *How to Answer* and *Tour* links, respectively - so the entire URL does *not* need to be specified. 

For example:

 - `[help]`   => [help center][1]
 - `[ask]`    => [How to Ask][2]
 - `[answer]` => [How to Answer][3]
 - `[about]` => [tour][4]
 - `[tour]` => [tour][4]
 - `[chat]` => [3D Printing Chat][5]
 - `[edit]` => Edit the post link

N.B. `[tour]` and `[about]` are equivalent.

See [comment formatting][6] for more information, or *better still*, see the [Complete list of help center magic links][7]. 

Also worthy of mention are *relative links*, so you can skip the *absolute URL* part (i.e. `https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com`). For example:

 - `[Ask Question](/questions/ask)` => Ask Question link (at the top of the page)

Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.

It's visible on the amount of views and votes that questions get, and the lack of answers on many questions. As well as a handful of users that are usually involved. It's unfortunate, I for example really like the (also relatively small) Information Security Stack site which is much more active.

I thought of ways to get people to even know about the existance of this site:
- Posting links to this site on other sites such as when posting a make, or object on Thingiverse and Printables
- Using it more commonly in YouTube comments or other comments to link to answers or questions that are applicable in the context
- Question Migration from more popular sites such as StackOverflow, below are some examples of search queries that result in many (not all) questions that belong to this site instead:
  - https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=3d+printing
  - https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=3d+print

  - https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=thingiverse
  - https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=grabcad 

I think migration (also from other sites) is perhaps the most effective for multiple reasons. As I believe the user is notified, also more relevant content is available on this site making it easier found when using search engines. What are your thoughts on this, why isn't this community bigger and more active, did it used to be, what was already tried?

It is worth remembering that *migration* only has a rather small window (of a few days or so) after which a question is deemed ""too old to migrate"" and the option just greyed out (or unavailable, I forget which now)... annoying I know, but those are the rules. 

IMHO, migration is pointless (and can require ""back-channel"" communication and agreements between sites) and just not worth the bother.

There are graphs and spreadsheets and databases that can be queried to give you this sort of info. Early numbers can be seen in [this (now rather ramshackle) answer][1] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/4762.

#### Subjective view

I have had the (possibly unjustified) feeling that the site has tailed off since early 2022 or so (as I noted at the end of [this answer][2] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/556/4762).

I have the overall impression that this site was vibrant and had at least 10+ permanently active users, seven years ago, back in 2016. The questions back then seemed to be more related to building DIY printers, or fixing Prusa printers and their clones, general Arduino questions and firmware issues. 

However, 3D printing has become much more mainstream, in the past few years, there are many more reliable manufacturers of printers that (apparently) just ""work out of the box"" and less people are building from scratch. So, less questions... apart from the initially flurry of Creality support questions when these printers first started to become popular (3-4 years ago?). However, even these types of questions seem to have tailed off, now.

Also, w.r.t. repair, as 0scar states, most of the tinkering and repairing questions have already been asked and answered, back in the days of DIY printers. However, now and again a good old-fashioned board repair question comes along that you can get your teeth into, but they are becoming increasingly infrequent.

#### General

It is worth remembering that *migration* only has a rather small window (of a few days or so) after which a question is deemed ""too old to migrate"" and the option just greyed out (or unavailable, I forget which now)... annoying I know, but those are the rules. 

IMHO, migration is pointless (and can require ""back-channel"" communication and agreements between sites) and just not worth the bother. Generally, it is much more simpler and efficient (and rapid) to just ask the poster to delete their question on the first site and just re-post it themselves on the new site.

#### Other sites

I looked at some of the [G-code questions on SO][1] and a number of them are related to simply programmatic issues, parsing issues or substitution, that don't have a 3D Printing end-game, and so they wouldn't be on-topic anyway.

The [Robotics site][2] was in a real lull until quite recently, when the ROS (Q&A) community was merged. In the past some 3D printing questions *were* posted there, and I *did* think about getting those migrated, but then the OP had a meltdown and rage-quit, so that was the end of that.

The [Engineering site][3] also has some 3D design/modelling questions that *could* have fitted here, but (as has been [stated elsewhere][4]) it is OK for some overlap to exist between SE sites, a question might be suited to *more than one site* and it doesn't really matter where it lands - the question just gets slightly re-jigged for the appropriate audience.

### Obvious mistakes

 - Typos
 - Spelling:
   - commonly used 3d -> [3D](https://www.lexico.com/definition/3d);
   - proper capitalizing:
     - printer/electronics make and model like:
       - ramps -> RAMPS, 
       - ender -> Ender, 
       - bltouch -> BLTouch, etc.;
     - software products like:
       - cura -> Cura, 
       - octoprint -> OctoPrint,
       - pronterface -> Pronterface 
     - Others:
       - gcode / g-code -> G-code;
 - Grammar.

### Salutations

 - Removal of signatures;
 - Removal of greetings, such as ""Hi""/""Hi there"";
 - Removal of 'Hope this helps' - ""*Stack Overflow is like an encyclopedia, so we prefer to omit these types of phrases. It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*"" - I saw this quote on SO.
 - Removal of ""Thanks"" - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for ""Hope this helps"", then the same can be applied to ""Thanks"" - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also ""Thanks"" reduces the encyclopedia ""look"" of SE.

### Correct use of SI units

 - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; 
 - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];
 - Temperature units:
   - Celsius: c or C or oC -> &deg;C (`&deg;C`)
   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -> &deg;F (`&deg;F`)
 - Electrical units: 
   - Voltage: v -> V; 
   - Current: a -> A; 
   - Resistance: Ohms -> &Omega; (`&Omega;`) 


### Presentation

 - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;
 - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;
 - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. 
 - Remove instances of ""EDIT:"" and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.

### Text formatting

 - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `<br>`) when there is a markdown equivalent;
 - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;
 - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.
 - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).

### Images

 - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags;
 - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![<imagedescription>][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the ""outside"" wrapper brackets get lost;
 - Orientation of image - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][3].

### Inlining links

 - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;
 - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.

### Title

 - Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itse","5"

Many sites use title statements rather than questions - to be honest, either seem acceptable, so just changing titles (of old questions) into grammatically correct interrogations seems unnecessary. You could do that for the new posts, as they aren't yet established - but if you are trying to look up an older question and the title has been changed, then that could be taken as ""making the post more confusing"".

That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better.

As this is a small site (with little traffic, as discussed in your [previous meta post][1]), most of the questions have been edited to death already and as such, it can be difficult to find things to fix. It is probably best to stick to new posts that need editing, or if an older post is blatantly incorrect and has been missed then that should be fixed.

Focusing on #5 for a moment, adding the ""Longer LK5 Pro"" to the title is *redundant* as the question is already tagged with [tag:longer-lk5]. Generally, when a question is tagged with ""*something*"", that ""*something*"" is then *removed* from the title due to redundancy (I don't have a meta link for that nugget of information, at the moment).

That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better. That was one that I rejected, IIRC purely because it is an old question that already has an answer (that probably should have been accepted, had the user returned to the site after posting the question).

Actually, sticking with #3, the ""*with TMC2208 and Klipper*"" in the title should be removed as it is redundant, due to the tags (going by what was said above), which (by those rules) would leave the title as just:

> Creality Sprite Extruder custom install on Ender 3 Pro

which *really* is *utterly meaningless*! LOL. :-) So, maybe the *part* of your suggested edit that includes the voltage is a very good idea - even though the answer then states that the voltages should be ignored - so something like this:

> How to Configure the TMC2208 Driver Voltage for a Creality Sprite Extruder custom install

and maybe tag with [tag:ender-3-pro], if there is one, otherwise the [tag:ender-3] tag might suffice..? However, I'm not sure how the Ender printers are meant to be tagged, and I might be wrong. There was a Meta post somewhere by Trish and/or 0scar.

So, in summary, I would reject all of those edits again, apart from #3 as the title is a bit of a mess anyway - remove the redundant already tagged info from the title and mention the stepper driver voltages. If you suggest that edit, I'll accept it :-)

#### The problem with mods doing reviews

As there really are *so few* regular users on the site, the review queues often fall to the moderators - otherwise they would never be cleared. 

One issue with mods undertaking reviews, is that we are *unable* to vote as normal users, see [Add a way for moderators to","5"

### Obvious mistakes

 - Typos
 - Spelling:
   - commonly used 3d -> [3D](https://www.lexico.com/definition/3d);
   - proper capitalizing:
     - printer/electronics make and model like:
       - ramps -> RAMPS, 
       - ender -> Ender, 
       - bltouch -> BLTouch, etc.;
     - software products like:
       - cura -> Cura, 
       - octoprint -> OctoPrint,
       - pronterface -> Pronterface 
     - Others:
       - gcode / g-code -> G-code;
 - Grammar.

### Salutations

 - Removal of signatures;
 - Removal of greetings, such as ""Hi""/""Hi there"";
 - Removal of 'Hope this helps' - ""*Stack Overflow is like an encyclopedia, so we prefer to omit these types of phrases. It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*"" - I saw this quote on SO.
 - Removal of ""Thanks"" - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for ""Hope this helps"", then the same can be applied to ""Thanks"" - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also ""Thanks"" reduces the encyclopedia ""look"" of SE.

### Correct use of SI units

 - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; 
 - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];
 - Temperature units:
   - Celsius: c or C or oC -> &deg;C (`&deg;C`)
   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -> &deg;F (`&deg;F`)
 - Electrical units: 
   - Voltage: v -> V; 
   - Current: a -> A; 
   - Resistance: Ohms -> &Omega; (`&Omega;`) 


### Presentation

 - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;
 - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;
 - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP. 
 - Remove instances of ""EDIT:"" and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.

### Text formatting

 - Removing HTML tags (i.e. `<br>`) when there is a markdown equivalent;
 - List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;
 - Quotes must be *blockquote formatted* **and** have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.
 - Code formatting: G-codes should be *code formatted*, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (\`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (\`\`\`).

### Images

 - Image descriptions, *and* image hover tags (see [this answer][3] for an example);
 - Clickable image display - i.e. `[![<imagedescription>][x]][x]`, sometimes, somehow, the ""outside"" wrapper brackets get lost;
 - Orientation of image - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of ""manual"" labour in an image editor;
 - Ensure that the image has been added to the *Stack Exchange* imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to [link-rot][4].

### Inlining links

 - Inlining links with the title of the linked page;
 - Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.

### Title

Possibly, at first glance at your links, I would avoid just changing the title into a question (from an already grammatically correct statement) on an *old established* question - as this adds little to the post and just bumps the question (again).

From your examples: #1, #2, #4 and #5 just seem to change a couple of words, but with little (or no) added value - apart from making a grammatical question, which isn't really strictly necessary. Many sites use title statements rather than questions - to be honest, either seem acceptable, so just changing titles (of old questions) into grammatically correct interrogations seems unnecessary. You could do that for the new posts, as they aren't yet established - but if you are trying to look up an older question and the title has been changed, then that could be taken as ""making the post more confusing"". 

Also, there are *a lot* of question titles that aren't questions (but statements instead), and converting them *all* would mean a lot of suggested edit reviews - all for little to no gain.

Focusing on #5 for a moment, adding the ""Longer LK5 Pro"" to the title is *redundant* as the question is already tagged with [tag:longer-lk5]. Generally, when a question is tagged with ""*something*"", that ""*something*"" is then *removed* from the title due to redundancy (see the section **Avoid putting tags in the question title** under [this answer][1] to [How do I make a good edit?][2]).

That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better. That was one that I rejected, purely because (IIRC) it is an old question that already has an answer (that probably should have been accepted, had the user returned to the site after posting the question).

Actually, sticking with #3, the ""*with TMC2208 and Klipper*"" in the title should be removed as it is redundant, due to the tags (going by what was said above), which (by those rules) would leave the title as just:

> Creality Sprite Extruder custom install on Ender 3 Pro

which *really* is *utterly meaningless*! LOL. :-) So, maybe the *part* of your suggested edit that includes the voltage is a very good idea - even though the answer then states that the voltages should be ignored - so something like this:

> How to configure the TMC2208 Driver Voltage for a Creality Sprite Extruder custom install

and maybe tag with [tag:ender-3-pro], if there is one, otherwise the existing [tag:ender-3] tag might suffice..? However, I'm not sure how the Ender printers are meant to be tagged, and I might be wrong. There was a Meta post/discussion somewhere by Trish and/or 0scar about a possible hierarchy of tags, i.e. something *like* [tag:creality] and[tag:Ender] and then [tag:3], which I think was rejected - however, I've had a good look and really can't find the meta post.

So, in summary, I would reject all of those edits again, apart from #3 as the title is a bit of a mess anyway - remove the redundant already tagged info from the title and mention the stepper driver voltages. If you suggest that edit, I'll accept it :-)

### Suggestions

As this is a small site (with little traffic, as discussed in your [previous meta post][3]), most of the questions have been edited to death already and as such, it can be difficult to find things to fix. It is probably best to stick to **new posts** that haven't yet been edited, or if an older post is blatantly incorrect and has been missed then that should be fixed.

You might find this useful: https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/500/4762

I notice that you've added some tags in other suggested edits. Many of these tags have no description, which can make it a bit harder to review the suggested edit, w.r.t the validity of the tag.  If you could edit such ""empty"" tags, with descriptions and usage, that would be *really* useful. In which case, these are related:

Similar concerns about the size of the community have been raised for many years, as the links below show.

### Migration

#### General

It is worth remembering that *migration* only has a rather small window (of a few days or so) after which a question is deemed ""too old to migrate"" and the option just greyed out (or unavailable, I forget which now)... annoying I know, but those are the rules. 

IMHO, migration is pointless (and can require ""back-channel"" communication and agreements between sites) and just not worth the bother. Generally, it is much more simpler and efficient (and rapid) to just ask the poster to delete their question on the first site and just re-post it themselves on the new site.

A *very* similar question was asked recently on the Robotics Meta, please read [Can/should questions on Stack Overflow about ROS be migrated here?][1]. The [answer][2] seems to also apply to this site and (more or less) re-iterates what I said above.

Also, [this answer][3] to [Is ""Too old to migrate"" a good reason NOT to migrate?][4] is really useful.

#### Other sites

I looked at some of the [G-code questions on SO][5] and a number of them are related to simply programmatic issues, parsing issues or substitution, that don't have a 3D Printing end-game, and so they wouldn't be on-topic anyway.

The [Robotics site][6] was in a real lull until quite recently, when the [ROS (Q&A) community was merged][7]. In the past some 3D printing questions *were* posted there, and I *did* think about getting those migrated, but then the OP had a meltdown and rage-quit, so that was the end of that.

The [Engineering site][8] also has some 3D design/modelling questions that *could* have fitted here, but (as has been [stated elsewhere][9]) it is OK for some overlap to exist between SE sites, a question might be suited to *more than one site* and it doesn't really matter where it lands - the question just gets slightly re-jigged for the appropriate audience.

### Traffic
There are graphs and spreadsheets and databases that can be queried to give you this sort of info. Early numbers can be seen in [this (now rather ramshackle) answer][10] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/4762.

Also (vaguely) related are questions discussing participation:

- https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/511/4762
- more to be added as they are found...

#### A subjective view

I have had the (possibly unjustified) *feeling* that the site has tailed off since early 2022 or so (as I noted at the end of [this answer][11] to https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/556/4762).

My *overall impression* is that this site was vibrant and had at least 10+ permanently active users, seven years ago, back in 2016. The questions back then seemed to be more related to:

- building DIY printers;
- fixing Prusa printers and their clones;
- filament queries;
- general Arduino questions, and;
-  firmware issues. 

However, 3D printing has become much more mainstream, in the past few years, there are many more reliable manufacturers of printers that (apparently) just ""work out of the box"" and less people are building from scratch. So, less questions... apart from the initial flurry of Creality support questions<sup>1</sup>, when these printers first started to become popular (4-5 years ago?). 

Nevertheless, even these types of questions seem to have tailed off, now, after a *subsequent* flurry of questions about Creality add-ons, such as the BLTouch (et al).

Also, w.r.t. repair, as 0scar states, most of the tinkering and repairing questions have already been asked and answered, back in the days of DIY printers. However, now and again a good old-fashioned board repair question comes along that you can get your teeth into, but they are becoming increasingly infrequent.

Nowadays, we *seem* to be down to a core of 4 or 5 regular visitors and  a few other less-regular users.

## A tale of 3 Printers
My tale of 3D printing began with a silly question about [perfect 3D printed dice.][1] Which, actually **didn't** star here: it was migrated from RPG.SE over here. It made me aware of the place. I made that question back then way before I had my own printer, but after a couple of material science classes that discussed pretty much the contents of the answer to the question and I tried to apply it to a hobby. It brought me to another hobby I would soon pick up: About christmas I bought my first printer, a TronXY X1. It was cheap, it was a tinker machine with a crazy wobbly gantry out of the box and I re-engineered [a gantry slider][2] for it that turned out to act like a spring on itself and keep the gantry with a little load and thus straight. It was a project in itself. In July 2018 I finally took my step to buy an Ender 3. The version 1, but not the very first production run. I started to look up trying to get an inductive probe running, so I figured out [voltage first][3], [then a setup][4], and came to a hiccup: I needed to update Firmware.

That firmware update sent me down the drain: I had never worked with firmware before, and half the answers were very cryptic to me as a beginner. But I sat down with Greenonline in chat and we went on a deep dive into what actually was the board in the machine I bought, and how to actually install firmware on it. It was a crazy few days for me, and I learned more between the bouts of feeling overwhelmed and seeing some success and waiting for an arduino to actually flash the firmware! It led to a flurry of questions: starting by [recalibrating][5], trying to [install hex firmware][6], [making my own hex file][7] for a modified firmware, and [flashing the board][8] before going full circle. Many of these questions would not be amiss on Adruino or Stack Overflow, but their context was always dealing with my printer. 

The Ender3 had just about as hefty a learning curve as dealing with the mechanical wobble of the TronXY X1 at first. But I had this community (and chat) as my support. Why was the learnign curve so hefty? Well, the initial V1 was not good. It was cheap, it had problems. [Like the Z-endstop is from the factory misaligned,][9] I ruinied [about 5 or such glue on surfaces][10], [Thermal Runaway PRotection wasn't flashed by default][11], the extriuder lever breaking could not be seen easily, leading me down to esoteric questions that to me now read like [""Why the F... is my Layer height wrong?""][12] and only some week after I noticed the break and got an aluminium replacement, firmware needed another upgrade to turn on [Power Loss recovery after the TRP upgrade did lack it][13] (though it never saw use - crazy stable power net here)...  I even started the [Knowledgebase tag][14] to make some of the most common-appearing questions easily findable. A Hotend swap required [a PID Tune][15] (which I only documented about a year later!)...

And then my Ender3 v1 broke as I moved it. The extruder stepper driver just fizzled. So I bought an Ender3 V2, put it together but out of the box swapped the extruder for the aluminium one, and... I kind of realized that I had no more questions that I either hadn't learned or asked about previously and that the Ender3 V2 was out of the box and much more user-friendly. It just... **worked**. Sure, it does not come with mesh bed leveling, its firmware isn't perfect, but it just worked.

3D printing had changed **so much** over the years since I started as a 3rd generation hobbyist (as in: 1st Gen was Reprap, 2nd gen was parts kits, 3rd gen is early (ca pre-2019) printers and now... we are way deep in Gen 4 or 5 printers that actively build on the problems of their predecessors.

### Obvious mistakes

 - Typos
 - Spelling:
   - commonly used 3d -> [3D](https://www.lexico.com/definition/3d);
   - proper capitalizing:
     - printer/electronics make and model like:
       - ramps -> RAMPS, 
       - ender -> Ender, 
       - bltouch -> BLTouch, etc.;
     - software products like:
       - cura -> Cura, 
       - octoprint -> OctoPrint,
       - pronterface -> Pronterface 
     - Others:
       - gcode / g-code -> G-code;
 - Grammar.

### Salutations

 - Removal of signatures;
 - Removal of greetings, such as ""Hi""/""Hi there"";
 - Removal of 'Hope this helps' - ""*Stack Overflow is like an encyclopedia, so we prefer to omit these types of phrases. It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.*"" - I saw this quote on SO.
 - Removal of ""Thanks"" - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for ""Hope this helps"", then the same can be applied to ""Thanks"" - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also ""Thanks"" reduces the encyclopedia ""look"" of SE.

### Correct use of SI units

 - SI units are the standard *(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)*; 
 - Adding non-breaking space before SI units (`&nbsp;`) - see [Don't forget the space!][2];
 - Temperature units:
   - Celsius: c or C or oC -> &deg;C (`&nbsp;&deg;C`)
   - Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -> &deg;F (`&nbsp;&deg;F`)
   - Kelvin: k -> K (`&nbsp;K`) [No degree sign!]
 - Electrical **units**: 
   - [Voltage][3]/Volt: v -> V;
   - [Current][4]/Ampere: a -> A; 
   - [Resistance][5]: Ohms -> &Omega; (`&Omega;`) 
   - [Power][6]: Watt -> w -> W

- Electrical science uses a set of nigh **universal variables** when writing down formulas:
   - Voltage/Potential Difference: U/V
   - Current/Flow: I
   - Resistance: R
   - Power: P


### Presentation

 - Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;
 - Replace slang, or *text-speak*, with grammatical English;
 - Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information.

It’s that time of the year again! As we wave goodbye to last year and welcome the new one, we have [a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year](https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=""year+in+moderation""+is%3Aquestion).

As most of you here might be aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:

> We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.  
> -- [A Theory of Moderation](http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/)

That doesn't eliminate the need for having [moderators](https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/) altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks — folks like you. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference in ensuring Stack Exchange sites remain a valuable source of high-quality content on the web.

So as we say goodbye to 2023 (and January 2024… ahem) and move into 2024, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some [_exciting_ stats](https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmN7M.gif).

#### From earlier comments

I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that [tag:slicer] has no tag info, defining how the tag is *meant* to be used, whereas [tag:slicing] *does* have a clear tag usage.

---

#### At first look

There are currently 204 [tag:slicing] questions and 6 [tag:slicer] questions.

The missing tag info for [tag:slicer] is easy to add - I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see **Further Analysis**).

Whilst having two tags seems to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented). This isn't an insurmountable task, although 204 is a bit of a chore. It's been done before, see the maker and model meta question, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/430/4762.

However, if while checking whether the questions *have* been tagged correctly,  it then becomes a bit of a headache actually distinguishing the questions correctly - that is to say, determining whether [tag:slicing] or [tag:slicer] (or even both!) applies - then maybe, one *should* be the synonym of the other.

#### Further analysis

Looking at the *dates* of the two groups of questions, it seems that [tag:slicer] is actually a (relatively) recent tag, presumably introduced in May 2021 with this question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/16372/4762 , which seems to be reasonable as the question is about Cura, rather than slicing, in general. However, I might be wrong in thinking this, I don't know - maybe [tag:slicing] would have still be sufficient tag for this question, in which case, the whole [tag:slicer] issue started with this question. 

**However**, further checking reveals that [tag:slicer] was only added to *that question, a month ago by [this edit](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/revisions/16372/3). So, really, this question could be retagged to [tag:slicing] without issue, as it has only had the (alleged) ""wrong"" tag for a few weeks.

That leaves 5 questions, and then the next oldest question tagged [tag:slicer] is https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21705/4762, which is where and when the [tag:slicer] tag was introduced - 30 Nov 2023 - so it *really* is a late addition. Interestingly, the same user edited the previous, older question to add the [tag:slicer].

Again, this question could be considered to be about *slicers* rather than *slicing*, but whether that merits having a new tag, that could cause endless confusion, and mis-tagging, down the line.

#### Was there a need for a new ""slicer"" tag?

I would like to ask the OP, who introduced the [tag:slicer] tag, their reasoning for doing so, as well as:

- Why no tag info was added?
- Was the existing [tag:slicing] deemed not to be appropriate, if so, why not?

I would suggest that we wait for an answer/response to those questions, before we blat the [tag:slicer] tag.

There may be a legitimate reason to have a distinct tag, especially if there is a need and desire to separate *software* from *process*.

#### Moving forward

It may be decided by the community that a distinction *is* required and hence the need for two tags.

However, if it is determined that there isn't a real need for a new tag, then we have two options:

- Create a synonym
- Just re-tag the [tag:slicer] questions to [tag:slicing]

#### From earlier comments

> Yeah, sounds like it *could* be a good idea. However, is there really no difference between [tag:slicer] and [tag:slicing]? I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that [tag:slicer] has no tag info, defining how the tag is *meant* to be used, whereas [tag:slicing] *does* have a clear tag usage.

> 
> Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged [tag:slicing] are more process oriented and those tagged [tag:slicer] are more software oriented?

---

#### At first look

As stated in the question, there are currently 204 [tag:slicing] questions and 6 [tag:slicer] questions.

The missing tag info for [tag:slicer] is easy to add - anyone can do so. I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see **Further Analysis**).

Whilst having two tags *seems* to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented). This isn't an insurmountable task, although 204 is a bit of a chore. It's been done before, see the maker and model meta question, https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/430/4762.

However, if while checking whether the questions *have* been tagged correctly,  it then becomes a bit of a headache actually distinguishing the questions correctly - that is to say, determining whether [tag:slicing] or [tag:slicer] (or even both!) applies - then maybe, one *should* be the synonym of the other.

#### Further analysis

Looking at the *dates* of the two groups of questions, it seems that [tag:slicer] is actually a (relatively) recent tag, presumably introduced in May 2021 with this question, https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/16372/4762 , which seems to be reasonable as the question is about Cura, rather than slicing, in general. However, I might be wrong in thinking this, I don't know - maybe [tag:slicing] would have still be sufficient tag for this question, in which case, the whole [tag:slicer] issue started with this question. 

**However**, further checking reveals that [tag:slicer] was only added to *that* question, a month ago by [this edit](https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/revisions/16372/3). So, really, this question could be retagged to [tag:slicing] without issue, as it has only had the (alleged) ""wrong"" tag for a few weeks.

That leaves 5 remaining [tag:slicer] questions, and then the next oldest question tagged [tag:slicer] is https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21705/4762, which is where and when the [tag:slicer] tag was introduced - 30 Nov 2023 - so it *really* is a late addition. Interestingly, the same user edited the previous, older question to add the [tag:slicer].

Again, this question could be considered to be about *slicers* rather than *slicing*, but whether that merits having a new tag, that could *potentially* cause endless confusion, and mis-tagging, down the line.

<sub> The other four remaining questions were tagged as [tag:slicer] by their respective OPs, and while at least two of them (https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21735/4762 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22980/4762) could be considered correctly tagged as [tag:slicer], IMHO moving them to [tag:slicing] wouldn't harm the questions. The other two (https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22846/4762 and https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/23008/4762) look to have been incorrectly tagged, and [tag:slicing] would be more appropriate.</sub>

#### Was there a need for a new ""slicer"" tag?

I would like to ask the OP, who introduced the [tag:slicer] tag, their reasoning for doing so, as well as:

There are some options now:

- reclassify those 6 questions into ""slicing"" and then set the two tags as synonyms
- clarify the purpose of each tag which likely includes renaming them, because right now picking the correct one may not be obvious to most users. This may involve a general (re)classification into each tag of questions which were mistagged or not tagged with either one

We could

- delete ""slicer"" and retag the 6 questions into ""slicing"" but we should also add a description for it,
- rename them into ""slicer-software"" and ""slicing-theory"" to make obvious to most people whether we are talking about usage or the math/theory behind.

Since the theory behind slicing should be covered by a tag (there are questions about it from time to time) and I see none, ""slicing-theory"" could be the one. Of course some (re)tagging to make use of the new tag is needed.

I am in favour of the latter.","2"

As the [help][1] states:

> You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.

Unfortunately, neither of your questions fit that criteria.

Therefore, the community voted to close.

Thereafter, any subsequent edits did not help the questions to address the initial reasons for closure (as explained more fully below)

---

The first question about the medical applications, as I had already explained in the comments, was not suitable for a Q&A site:

> I would imagine that there are a number of on-going research projects. However, research across the various fields of medicine seems rather a broad area. As such, any comprehensive answer would need to be really long, and just a list of links to projects - a list that would be continually changing as time goes by. For that reason, it doesn't seem that your type of question is particularly suitable, as it currently stands, for this site - it is just too broad a question. If you could narrow the scope of the question (to a particular field) then that might make it easier to answer appropriately

I then aggregated the links from a deleted answer, that appeared to answer your initial edit of your question, into a couple of comments, so that you could at least see them.

I then explained:

> Maybe all of the links (and associated abstracts), in these comments, could be put into one single wiki-type answer that anyone could contribute to... that is a possibility. However, that would/could still result in a never-ending list answer that gets bigger and bigger and which would/could end up breaking Stack Exchange's Q&A format. On the other hand, if multiple answers were posted, how could you select the accepted answer..?

I now realise that I mis-spoke when I said:

> If you could narrow the scope of the question (to a particular field) then that might make it easier to answer appropriately

As the issue would still remain, regardless of scope - except that the list of linked papers would be a little shorter.

Apologies for having got your hopes up, and your futile scope edits.

----

The second question was opinion based, *initially* asking about materials. Subsequent edits just *changed the subject upon which the opinion was asked*, from materials, to UX or UI (?), then to cost (for which you got a range of opinions in the comments), back to UX/UI and then finally an opinion on Octoprint. This last ""Octoprint"" edit contained a link to an unrelated product listing page (upon which octoprint was somewhere near the bottom), hence the spam flag.

---

To re-iterate the [help][1], neither of these questions seem to be based on actual problems that you face, but rather the start of a *discussion*. Discussions are, unfortunately, out of scope of Stack Exchange, as a Q&A site.

**Please also be aware that after a system-determined number of failed edits and re-open votes, the system (not the community or moderators) could implement a question ban or suspension. In order to avoid this, please try to ask *""practical, answerable questions""* and not opinion-based discussion based topics.**

Besides that if you continually edit the sense, or topic, of a question, then users will get confused, fatigued, or ""turned off"", as some comments have indicated. So, please, try to plan your question in advance so that multiple subsequent edits aren't required.

If you, or anyone else, wishes to go through all of the questions and perform the *""slicer-software"" and ""slicing-theory""* procedure, then you are more than welcome. You don't need to be a mod or admin, or whatever to do that.

Anyone with sufficient reputation can create tags, create tag descriptions, synonyms and perform retagging. 

See [Privileges][1] for more information:

- 150 -> create tags
- 1250 -> tag synonyms
- 1500 -> approve tag edits
