<p>I'm a <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/moderator-pro-tempore/"">Moderator Pro Tem</a> on <a href=""http://startups.stackexchange.com/"">Startups</a> and <a href=""http://patents.stackexchange.com"">Ask Patents</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a concern that pertains to moderation on either of those sites and would like to speak with me in private, feel free to flag a post (preferably a related one to your concern, but flagging your own post will do if that doesn't apply) using the ""Other..."" reason and I or one of my fellow moderators can open a private chat room for us.</p>

<p>My amateur radio call sign is KF7WLP.</p>

<p>I've been programming since I was eight, working on several projects during that time, some for fun and some for pay (which, you know, is also fun). I'm now dev lead at Haugen Applications, a company my father founded a while back in Nova Scotia, Canada.</p>

<p>I tend to take the ""a little knowledge about a lot of things"" route in computer science, but I'm a quick learner when it comes to new technologies so I find I can get the hang of fairly advanced topics in little enough time that I can pretend I know what I'm talking about. With that said, I currently have no formal training in CS so most of what I know is from experience and reading. My working rule of thumb is that I'd rather be able to go to university without student loans and for fun than do it because I'm supposed to and find myself in huge amounts of debt and at the same job when I get out.</p>

<p>Day-to-day, I use C# and T-Sql mostly with some JavaScript here and there. I also have working proficiency in Java and C++, and I'm probably forgetting a few in the mix. Most of what I do these days is web-related, both through writing websites and writing (and on some rare occasions, reading) APIs. I used to live and breathe Windows Forms, but something magical happened at some point in my life and I moved on from them.</p>

<p>I'm a student from Ohio who enjoys programming... </p>

<p><em>A LOT</em></p>

<p>Okay, maybe not that obsessed.</p>

<p>But still, I enjoy programming. I joined StackOverflow because I have recently begun some of the problems on Project Euler.
For those who do not know, Project Euler is a website that provides mathematical problems that require you to write an algorithm to solve it.</p>

<p>Apart from Programming, I try to mess around with Electrical Engineering, and a bit of Mechanical.
But my main passion is Robotics Engineering, the mixture of them all.</p>

<p>I also like photography, wood carving, flute playing, and other strange things that one might expect a nerd to enjoy.</p>

<p>Open to providing a 3D print service in the Cambridge, UK vicinity. See <a href=""https://www.thingiverse.com/tsh2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://www.thingiverse.com/tsh2</a> for contact.</p>

<p>I'm available, in a volunteering capacity, to support education events around the Cambridge area, provided these are STEM focused, and involve specific technical activities or relate to 'typical careers and working conditions' in engineering and technology.</p>

<p>I'm thinking about writing a series of blog posts centred around the 'Performing Engineering Operations Level 2' NVQ qualification. There doesn't seem to be much good source material, the teaching (of assessed knowledge) is poor, and the questions asked for assessment have no real answers at all.</p>

<p>I'm also desperate to drag the pre-university teaching of electronics and computing way from 1970's hardware examples. I see students today learning with NE555, and 7805 - these components are as old as me, and are much less likely to be the correct choice. There are questions about pre-forming components - components are, in the main, now designed for automated pick-and-place, not wire-wrap and hand assembly.</p>

<p>Hello, my name is Ryan, I'm an elected moderator on <a href=""https://arqade.com""><strong>Arqade</strong></a> (Video gaming) and <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/""><strong>Sustainable Living</strong></a>.</p>
<p>I'm a senior full-stack software engineer with years of experience in Web, Apps, RESTful APIs and Microservices development. My current tech stack consists primarily of HTML5/JS (React, Typescript) for web development, microservices on AWS Lambda (Node.js and C#), and PostgreSQL.</p>
<p>Over the years I've worked with a multitude of technologies: ASP.NET, Android/iOS development, Xbox One and Windows 10 Apps (Both XAML and HTML based ones), Java and so on.</p>

<h3>What I do for fun</h3>
<p>I volunteer in environment &amp; sustainability groups in my local area (if you're into that sort of stuff, you should join <a href=""https://sustainability.stackexchange.com/"">Sustainable Living SE</a>!)</p>
<p>I enjoy many video, board and card games; I very, VERY occasionally upload gaming clips to <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-9C2jWUstGzt89083JsGqQ"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">YouTube</a>. I enjoy achievement hunting, especially for achievements that make you approach a situation differently (e.g. beating a boss with only melee attacks) - it's good fun to come up with different strategies, and it's a good excuse to revisit older games.</p>
<p>I run a D&amp;D campaign, and regularly play in other campaigns and/or one-night stories. Here's a short <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-cJCCNuc1mw&amp;list=PLr5zfvGepa2H0WK8CxXGYN5H87zFN_VLa"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Star Wars campaign</a> my friend hosted for a bit, I play a Droid called TA-1, check it out!</p>

<p>From 2001-2015 I was the Pixar Tech Lead of the Data Management Group. My 50-year charter was to store and catalog all data and metadata related to the Studio's feature films.  This system (""Templar"") is in use to this day.</p>

<p>From 1997 to 2001 I lived in Beijing, China and was the Chief Software Architect at AsiaInfo, the company that built China's Internet.  While there my software was used to grow the China Internet from 200K to 65M users.  The last I heard they were at 350M+ users.</p>

<p>I studied computer science and worked in Texas for many years.  I wrote a couple of computer books... the best one was in print for 20 years.</p>

<p>I haven't used a Windows desktop in years!  I'm happiest in Linux, preferably <a href=""http://serverfault.com/?tags=centos"">CentOS</a>, but I also use MacOS and <a href=""http://serverfault.com/questions/tagged/linuxmints"">Linux Mint</a> almost every day.</p>

<p>About 400 watchmakers retire every year, but only 75 to 100 enter the profession. That’s good news for watchmakers, but for consumers it means prices are going to keep going up.”</p>
<p><a href=""http://blog.watchdoctor.biz/2019/05/06/where-are-all-the-watchmakers/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://blog.watchdoctor.biz/2019/05/06/where-are-all-the-watchmakers/</a></p>
<p>There were just more than 2,100 watch repairmen in the United States in May 2017, according to the Bureau of Labor statistics. That’s a slight “tick” up from the previous year’s numbers.
Ficklan said the market for mechanical timepieces fluctuates with the economy and other factors, and sales declined 3 to 4 percent last year. But he believes luxury mechanical watches are here to stay.</p>

<p>The start of my programming career came from my time served in the US Army. I was a 25U - <em>Signal Support System Specialist</em>.<br>
While my job was based more on networking &amp; radios and didn't really have much to do with programming, my AIT instructor was familiar with C+ and that's ultimately where I became interested in the subject.</p>

<p>Here is another short list, a list of pet peeves I have collected on Stack Overflow and related websites:</p>
<h3>SI units</h3>
<p>To avoid ambiguities, there is a general consensus on how to format physical units. Please try to follow them, it helps the flow when reading, and it helps when trying to understand exactly what you are talking about. The official guidelines are offered in chapter 5 of the <a href=""http://www.bipm.org/utils/common/pdf/si_brochure_8_en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SI brochure</a>, but there is a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Unit_symbols_and_the_values_of_quantities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">summary</a> with a couple of examples on Wikipedia.</p>
<p>A particular problem is the <em>space</em> between the value and the unit, for example: 12 V, not 12V. A common hack is to use the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-breaking_space"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">non-breaking space</a>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code>, to prevent the browser wrapping the line between the value and the unit. The problem with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> is that it is often interpreted as a <em>fixed width</em> space, meaning that it will not render as the same width as a normal space, but wider. Unicode has solved this problem by introducing the <code>NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE</code> symbol, <code>&amp;#8239;</code>.</p>
<p>My recommendation is that you use <code>&amp;#8239;</code> to format SI units. This difference may or may not be visible in your browser:</p>
<ul>
<li>12 V (normal space)</li>
<li>12 V (&amp;nbsp;)</li>
<li>12 V (&amp;#8239;)</li>
</ul>
<h3><em>&quot;I'm in Europe.&quot;</em></h3>
<p>This means <em>nothing</em>. Nothing at all to anyone trying to help you with a question you might have. Either write your <em>country</em>, or just leave it out - There's a world of difference (literally) between Turkey, Switzerland, Portugal, Romania, United Kingdom and Iceland. Different laws, different business structures, different traditions, different standards. The same goes for Asia.</p>
<p>Leaving out your country means that you will not get help with questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this legal?</li>
<li>Where can I buy things?</li>
</ul>

<p>While I wish I could have continued my time here, that was out of my hands when I was laid off with 28% of the company. I wish the best to my fellow CMs and I hope they're able to continue doing the best they can - as they already were. This is a wonderful place and there's so much potential if we can all work towards it together.</p>
<p>Prior to my time as a CM, I was a moderator on two of the network sites - Interpersonal Skills and Arts &amp; Crafts, both of which I supported from their launch dates until I was hired.</p>
<p>I have a degree in Radio-TV-Film and used to work in the film industry, mostly doing casting. Before that, I was a voice major, so I know how to make myself heard in loud places.</p>

If you think disabling IPv6 is ever the correct solution to a problem then you are part of the problem. If you ask how to disable IPv6 you can expect a downvote from me. If you suggest disabling IPv6 as a solution you can expect a downvote from me.</p>

<p>In 2014 I applied a logistic growth model to the <a href=""https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">numbers published by Google</a> and predicted that 2018 Sep 1 would be the first day Google saw more than 50% IPv6 traffic and 2019 Jan 18 would be the last day Google saw more than 50% IPv4 traffic.</p>

<p>Since then IPv6 adoption has been slowing down while problems caused by IPv4 shortage has been getting much worse.</p>

<p>Aside from stuff pertaining to MSE, I occasionally speedrun (<a href=""https://www.speedrun.com/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>) or grind on RetroAchievements (<a href=""https://retroachievements.org/user/PrincessEev"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">profile</a>), and run several Discord servers. I also occasionally can be seen poking around other Stack Exchange sites (math is my specialty though), VGMaps, Pokémon Showdown, and spend a large time watching YouTube videos in a variety of STEM subjects or video games.</p>
<p>So far academically, I graduated from undergrad in the spring of 2019 and currently am in grad school. I also study topics on my own a fair bit, especially over breaks; recently, I've been studying from Apostol's <em>Introduction to Analytic Number Theory</em>. I still feel have a long way to go before I can call myself a &quot;master&quot; of any sort of mathematics, but if nothing else I feel like I have a quite broad knowledge pool that's stoked more interests than I can reasonably pursue in my lifetime.</p>
<p>Currently my personal inclinations lie towards algebraic topics (e.g. abstract algebra, category theory) but I've had quite an extensive look in analytic topics due to my coursework (especially real analysis, measure theory, functional analysis, and PDE theory). Ultimately, though, all math is cool and beautiful and I have a deep appreciation for all of it.</p>

<p>Favorite Quotes</p>

My first 'remote starting' and preheating car, I build in 1981. Also build an alarm for it, in 1981, that was exceptional. The really exceptional thing was that my car radio was stolen one night, the ONLY night I forgot to engage the alarm!</p>
<p>I have been making machines and things ever since. Now I make big vacuum systems all over the world, which are controlled and logged from my bed. So a machine in the middle of the desert can be pro-actively controlled and preventative repaired.</p>
<p>Vacuum &amp; pressure are my physical 'things'. Computers, control and coding are my mind things.</p>

But... my software history and experience is broader than that, going back to '84 when a coworker got tired of his Timex-Sinclair 1000, with membrane ""keyboard"", errorproof ROM BASIC, internal 4K RAM, and the optional 16K memory expansion module... and sold it to me $10. In '85, I started writing software professionally in Turbo Pascal under Digital Research's Concurrent CP/M on S-100 computers with Winchester 10MB hard drives and 8"" floppies.</p>

<p>I wrote a complete common graphics subsystem TSR and complete common windowing UI subsytem TSR in assembly language and tested it with MS BASIC PDS 7, before Microsoft introduced graphical Windows. At the same time, I wrote a structured BASIC (under DOS) multitasking and graphical display software for penitentiary security systems.</p>

<p>(the above occupational profile goes here)</p>

<p>In late 2008, the project I and about 300 other employees were working on was sent to Bangladesh and our office closed; I took the route of becoming an independent contractor, and have been one since that time.</p>

<p>Besides that listed on the occupational profile, I've helped redesign a simple but large MSSQL database, and I've even written one HTML/JavaScript visual-graphical game (including an AutoPlayer for lone users), drawing graphically on the HTML5 canvas; it works fine in Windows with FireFox, Opera, Chrome, and Safari, in Linux with FireFox and Opera, and on Android devices (Kindle &amp; Nook - I don't own an Android phone).</p>

<p>Besides the languages already mentioned, I've written software in QuickBasic, Visual Basic, IRL, and a smattering of Fortran and COBOL. I've built automated Excel tax-calculation spreadsheets, and countless detailed SketchUp 3D models (SketchUp replaced my old favorite, EasyCAD), designed &amp; laid out electronic schematics &amp; circuit boards (my early history was heavy with electronics and hand drafting) with ExpressSCH and ExpressPCB, written a JavaScript minifier, a matching deminifier, and a more simplistic comment stripper with blank-line elimination.</p>

<p>As sidelines, I have a rather respectable woodshop in the barn, three full-sized lathes in the basement, and a small machine shop. I've been gradually rebuilding nearly all of this house (everything except the timberframe and sheathing), including custom cabinetry (cherry &amp; maple solids, heavy maple and Meganite countertops), solid maple strip flooring, and a custom hyperinsulation system I designed. I've replumbed &amp; rewired everything. In what passes for ""spare time"", I like to restore pre-1987 vehicles, specializing in older Jeeps; I have a very good '68 Kaiser M715, an excellent '70 4WD GMC 2500, a '73 Jeep CJ5, a '74 CJ5 Renegade, and an '86 CJ7. I do all my own full disassembly, engine overhauls, rust abatement, body straightening &amp; Bondo, sanding, painting, electrical. I even work on neighbors' older vehicles.</p>

<p>It should be obvious by now that I don't watch TV. 8)</p>

The original R-36 was deployed under the GRAU index 8K67 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-9 Scarp. It was able to carry three warheads and was the first Soviet MRV(multiple reentry vehicle) missile.[1] The later version, the R-36M was produced under the GRAU designations 15A14 and 15A18 and was given the NATO reporting name SS-18 Satan. This missile was viewed by certain United States analysts as giving the Soviet Union first strike advantage over the U.S., particularly because of its rapid silo-reload ability, very heavy throw weight and extremely large number of re-entry vehicles. Some versions of the R-36M were deployed with 10 warheads and up to 40 penetration aids and the missile's high throw-weight made it theoretically capable of carrying more warheads or penetration aids. Contemporary U.S. missiles, such as the Minuteman III, carried up to three warheads at most.</p>
<p>The R-36 became the base for the Tsyklon launch vehicles family. As of early 2018, Cyclone-4M, the last modification of it, is developed and planned for launch in 2020.</p>
<p>Russia intends to replace the R-36M with a new heavy ICBM, the RS-28 Sarmat.</p>
<p>Some R-36 missiles have been converted into Dnepr medium-lift launch vehicles, capable of putting up to 4,500kg into orbit.</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm a pro-tem moderator (♦) over on the <a href=""https://langdev.stackexchange.com/"">Programming Language Design and Implementation</a> StackExchange. If you need mod-help for that site, give me a ping in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/146046/the-garbage-collector"">The Garbage Collector</a>, the site's main chat room.</li>
<li>I'm also a code golfer - it's what hooked me into sticking around SE and getting more involved than posting occasional answers on SO.</li>
<li>As such, I've made a <a href=""https://www.github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">golfing language called Vyxal (original naming, I know, but I'm also a programmer cut me some slack naming things is hard)</a>. In a nutshell:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Vyxal is an stack-based esoteric array language that is dedicated to dominating competition in code golf challenges. This means that it strips away all need for boilerplate, long function names and impractical source layouts. However, it also has a more traditional and familiar way of expressing itself if needed.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p>I'm currently in my 4th year of doing a Software Engineering degree, so that's something I'm doing with my life that isn't StackExchange.</p>
</li>
<li><p>One might say that I am somewhat of a memes enthusiast. That one would be correct, because I have that skibidi ohio rizz that all the fanum taxers mew about. Enjoy your lost brain cells.</p>
</li>
<li><p>I have a hobby of making AIs play chess when they really aren't designed to do so. Like that StackOverflow question formatting assistant thing. And v0 from Vercel. If you know of any other AIs that are jailbreakable and aren't designed to play chess (e.g. Fiverr neo - looking forward to getting my hands on that one), ping me in <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/125050/the-edge-of-propinquity"">The Edge of Propinquity</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>My profile picture is generated using a wide mix of genai image tools including Wumbo Dream, Let's Enhance, getimg.ai and probably some other tools.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Grammarly gave this bio a  emoji for tone. I don't know whether to be offended or to say to it &quot;uhm ackshully you're the nerd&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I am big into RC aircraft and embedded programming.  Very fun stuff.  I'm an aeronautical engineer, but I also do a lot with electronics, electrical engineering, and computer science/programming (including a lot with C/C++ in Arduino and some lower-level AVR code).

I became interested in scripting in 1998 after becoming frustrated with a manual user creation process... having so few options for Windows scripting, I turned to perl. I've dabbled in all the Windows scripting languages over the years eventually taking a job as an automation engineer in 2012.
All the above is still relevant but I have moved tangentially since: I'm now heavily using python3.x in Linux environments, processing 100k+ events per second in a security data processing team.</p>

Several of my software 'products' have been published in high-ranking, peer-reviewed journals, and are widely used throughout the international academic community: See, for example: <a href=""http://www.plantcell.org/content/29/11/2921"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">On-Guard</a> and <a href=""http://www.plantphysiol.org/content/177/4/1368"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">EZ-Rhizo</a>.</p>

<p>Almost all my programming is in C++, and mostly for the <em>Windows</em> platform; <em>Visual Studio</em> (using MFC) is my preferred development environment, though I am in the early stage of experimenting with porting code to <em>MacOS</em> (Xcode/Cocoa).</p>

<p>I have been programming for over 25 years! However, in the last year or so I have decided to 'get up to speed' with the latest developments in C++, like the Standard Template Library, smart pointers and C++17 (and maybe even C++20, at some point).</p>

<p><strong>Business Description:
The current trend in physical therapy is to treat a high volume of patients, which results in less individual attention. During most one-hour treatments, a patient will only spend 15 minutes with a physical therapist because the therapist sees multiple patients simultaneously. Some of your treatment time is even spent with non-licensed aides and technicians doing exercises.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Business Description
Orlando Thrive Therapy is a private-pay practice and payment is due at the time of your therapy service. We have made a very careful decision not to allow insurance to dictate how we provide services to treat you or who we are allowed to work with. We believe successful outcomes in therapy happen when you are seen as more than a diagnosis and a variety of therapeutic techniques can be offered at one time. If you still need to use the medical model for treatment, contact your insurance provider for more information. If you would like more information about how we work and our unique approach, please contact us for a free 10-15 minute consult so we can help you get started.</strong></p>
