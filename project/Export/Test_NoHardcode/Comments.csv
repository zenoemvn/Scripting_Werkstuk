For Example, the question ""How Do I insert filament into the extruder?"" or ""why does printing size/speed/resolution matter?"" will be applicable to many new users, have a definite answer, and will have the original question-asker more enlightened in the subject of 3-D printing.","210"

I don't think the question was off-topic, as determining what kind of thermistor your printer has is something you might run into while 3D printing.

I'll keep this post in mind in the future and refrain from migrations on this subject until the community deems it on/off topic.

I'd still like to have the default, generic ""not about 3D printing"" close reason; also ""unclear what you're asking"" is a much more logical category for this close reason than ""off-topic"".","300"
"0","211","2017-02-16T19:30:02.047","115","","Hi, @TomvanderZanden! Sorry for the slow response, I didn't see your comments until now. First off, I re-added the default off-topic reason you mention (although it will need another moderator's approval to take effect); it seems like the default closing reason disappeared once we created a custom one.","301"
"0","211","2017-02-16T19:31:31.797","115","","@tbm0115, could you please verify the recreation of the default off-topic reason? :-)","302"
"0","211","2017-02-16T19:42:54.657","115","","@TomvanderZanden: It seems we only can create custom closing reasons in the ""off-topic"" category, and not in e.g the ""unclear"" category. Personally, I too would like the closing option suggested above to be a subcategory of ""unclear"". As you suggest, I usually end up using the ""unclear"" closing reason, and then add a specific reason in the comments; however, if having a custom ""off-topic"" reason is useful for some users, I don't see any harm in allowing them to choose. Do you think we should remove the custom closing reason all together?","303"

However, the modification by ""Song Khmer"" doesn't show up in the list of edits... so my question is, why does it say that it was modified by ""Song Khmer"" when in fact it wasn't..? This seems to me to be a site-wide bug, as it probably isn't only restricted to SE 3D Printing.","311"

Generally a specific migration ""pathway"" has to be agreed between sites, I think, and only then is that particular SE site is manually added as an option to the migration dialog. There is a post from a few years ago on SE.Arduino - I think I asked the same question (but it may have been in a comment). I'll try to dig out a link.","316"

There are a number of questions appearing that include videos of people's issues, where the video will much more easily describe the issue, than a written description. ""A video is worth a million words"", so to speak...","329"

Like Tormod mentions, we may need to provide a justification to turn it on.  The standard they noted was for it to be ""only turned on if the community thinks it's necessary to improve the quality of a good portion of their question base"".  I agree our site could benefit from inline video for some questions, but their standard is a pretty high bar.  Can we meet that?","335"
"0","233","2017-06-16T17:48:03.873","98","","I agree that it would be potentially better to expand the scope of this site. Unfortunately, I think the course of action in doing so would require the start of a completely new SE site around Machining or Manufacturing. I'm not sure if we can change the name of the site without a unanimous decision within this community which defeats the purpose of the Area 51 system. In the interim, it's important to ask questions that YOU feel fit within this community others in the SE network. It's then on moderators and community members to say yay/nay on its merit in the community. This will help us grow","336"

I am sure there are a lot of people in the group that could provide reviews for the printers they have and/or build logs for the printers they build/improved.  I am wondering on how to manage/vet that.  Is there a place where people could post and vote on BLOG topics so that everything is not on you?  Ex: Post an ongoing META question ""What posts would people be willing to write for the BLOG"".  Some sort of an example and/or style guide would help.","342"

It appears that those communities have more active members/moderators that are missing in the 3D Printing SE. You raise the waiving of raised flags, but there is much more going on. E.g. many topics with correct answers do not have accepted answers, questions do not receive much vote ups, nor do good answers. Accepting valid answers may also may be a task for moderators, but I understood that is not technically feasible. It is fair to start a discussion on this problem, but I think that there are too few active members","364"

Whilst I liked to go around fixing typos and mistakes in old questions, just to improve the general presentation of the site, it brought those posts to the top of the 'Active"" list, and I received some angry complaints about making ""noise"" - which was rather unfortunate. You are right, it would be good if there was a way of editing that prevented the post becoming active (such as a ""Non-active edit"" checkbox or button), although that might lead to other issues (secret/stealth edits).","371"

"0","262","2018-05-25T07:37:41.813","5740","","I realize that this may not get attention from SE as their reasoning would be that having active users and active moderators should prevent this from happening as edits should be made soon after posting of the question/answer.

While I was not actually torn a new one, here, a text format can easily come across as hostile and aggressive without very strong soft skills.

The problem is that text is not expressive enough, especially in hastily written, and character constrained, comments, and it is easy for something to be taken badly or appear to be a little harsh (the same can happen in email where the number of characters isn't limited). I am not one for emoticons and emojis but a smiley face _can_ help, now and again. Also, the _this-is-not-a--forum thing_ is true too, and can take a while to get used to.","382"

So let's make tags for all printers (e.g. AnetA2 is not there, but we have specific questions for them) and I thought that we could also link AnetA2 tag to e.g. Prusa as it is a Prusa clone printer or maybe better `cartesian` (e.g. mech. types are Cartesian, Delta, SCARA and Polar). Maybe I misunderstood the synonyms, but I thought of it as mathematical collections, so AnetA2 is a type of a collection Cartesian, but I'm beginning to understand that it is just rewording, correct?","409"
"0","287","2018-07-06T13:03:15.267","4762","","I don't think that the tagging works like that.

"1","404","2019-05-28T23:15:25.807","4762","","WRT how far should we go, looking at that laser question, it *seems* to be a g-code related issue - given that it has a g-code tag (rightly or wrongly), and therefore *maybe* on topic. As you say, as the common mechanics of laser engraving and 3D printing are, mostly, quite similar, then if the question is related to steppers, control, power, etc. then maybe it would be answerable. However, if it starts to ask about the finer points of engraving, then is there actually anyone here, or who comes here, who can answer that? If there isn't, then there's probably no point in asking it here.","626"

Often there are only two community votes - it's a small (active) community.

But, to your point, I'm aware that the community is rather small, and that because of that the other option might be that the close votes end up just aging away — and since y'all do wait so your vote isn't the first one, it's even less concerning that you're casting the votes.

Suggestions like that should probably be posted on SE.Meta, as they would affect all sites. A 200 rep limit already exists per question, I believe.

I started with a Ender 3 V2, I realize it has evolved a lot already but both cheaper or much better printers are available, I can buy a expensive machine but I rather buy a cheaper model and learn to upgrade it and understand the fundamentals of it. The knowledge gained from that is much more valuable to me than the actual printer is.

"0","600","2024-02-12T22:18:00.590","4762","","Thanks. Yes, I definitely agree. However, the devil's advocate in me says that having one tag for both process and software is great... for a small amount of questions. However, as the number of questions grows, and the two groups of questions grow in size, will it become more and more difficult for someone to find a ""slicer"" software-based question, when they aren't interested in the *process* (i.e. the ""slicing"" tagged questions)?

Whilst I was playing devil's-advocate in my comment above, I did have a secondary thought overnight that maybe even with two *well labelled* tags, we could still end up with a new user typing `slic` and then wondering which tag to choose, and potential mis-tagging occurring. So, I have now (for the moment)  come back over to the side of just one tag - just for ease of administration. Just my thoughts, this morning.","953"
"0","600","2024-02-13T09:22:43.547","4762","","However, it should be said that the proposal of having two tags has now changed the nature of your original question somewhat. We've gone from synonym, through removing this new `slicer` tag, and now back to having two tags. The more options that there are, then the more complication finding a resolution becomes. The correct way, would be to hammer out in *this* question what the options are, and then, once they have been decided, then a new voting meta question should really be posted so that a clear voting structure is achieved.","954"

The former option is *much* easier to implement. *By future-proof I mean that in ten years time, when there are 1000 questions, it will be easier to find a theory question or  a software question if we have two tags. The question is, do we want to go through some pain now to have this ""nice future""... or do we just put the issue off and have a similar situation to Y2k or UNIX 2038 bugs, and just let someone else deal with it, later..?* Over-dramatic?

"1","601","2024-02-15T15:00:29.153","4762","","Yes, good point. We can still do that, but I thought maybe posting two answers, might mean we don't need to post another meta vote question.
