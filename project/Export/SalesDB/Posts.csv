<hr />
<p>Sometimes it is a bit hard to see the wood for the trees...</p>
<p>Following on from tjb1's meta post, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/134/post-closing-issues"">Post Closing Issues</a>, it seems like we should widen the scope and be less strict about what is, and what is not, on-topic. What do people think? What additions, if any, should be made? Are there things that definitely should be on the list, that aren't currently?</p>
<p>So, with respect to our <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">On-topic page</a>, which needs updating, in order to get an idea of what people have been asking (&quot;why has my question been closed?&quot;/&quot;why is X not allowed&quot;),  I've gone through the Meta questions and come up with a list of questions that mentioned the words &quot;<a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=ask"">ask</a>&quot; and &quot;<a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=topic"">topic</a>&quot;. I then pulled out the questions relating to specifically what types of questions can/can't be asked.</p>
<p>A number of them seem to be able to be labeled as duplicates (inasmuch as they asked more or less the same thing), and so I have attempted to group them according to their suggestion request. The full list is at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>Even though I went through both lists twice - also, I didn't read <em>every</em> question and answer listed below fully - <em>there may be some suggestions that I have missed</em>. Please feel free to either suggest a change, or edit this post directly and add any that have gone astray (in that respect, maybe this question should be a wiki?).</p>
<p>Whilst we maybe don't want to change the aim of the site too much (as doing so may put off some regular users), maybe the scope needs to broaden slightly, as to have a wider appeal and be more <em>inclusive</em>.</p>
<p>BTW, a useful post to read is <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/6/what-should-our-documentation-contain"">What should our documentation contain?</a></p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>Admittedly, there will be overlap with some other SE sites and whilst we need to avoid the <em>too-broad-black-hole</em>, we should also welcome all things that are 3D Printer related, so as to keep all relevant knowledge in a central location.</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> WRT <strong>Components</strong>, and taking the <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/177/why-was-the-question-about-thermistors-migrated"">thermistors meta question</a> as an example, my first thought is that questions like this should remain, as they are pertinent to 3D Printing, otherwise we <em>could</em> theoretically end up compartmentalising printers and migrating off a lot of stuff to SE. Electronics, SE.Engineering, SE.Hardware Recommendations, etc.</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The same applies to the <strong>Misc/Anything 3D related</strong>, in particular the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/54/what-is-the-best-way-to-connect-3d-printed-parts""><em>Connecting 3D parts</em> question</a>. Yes, as some of the comments state, you could remove the 3D printer part and then it is basically an engineering question. However, when taken as a whole, this question <em>is</em> pertinent to 3D printing of large models, in parts.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> Also under <strong>Misc/Anything 3D related</strong>, Coding Ultimaker Cura <em>is</em> a SO type question, but it is <em>also</em> 3D printer specific</p>
<hr />
<h3>Additional suggestions in the future</h3>
<p>Instead of posting a new question, it <em>might</em> be a good idea to post an additional answer, containing the suggestion, to this question - in order to keep everything grouped together. This will save on the pain of having to go through all of the Meta questions as I have just done.</p>
<p>However, that might mean that the suggestion request would not have such prominence that it would do if the suggestion was posted independently as its own question... So (at the risk of duplication), if a new question/suggestion is posted, then it could be a good idea to also copy that new post and add it as an answer below.</p>

278,1,2018-06-14T17:39:58.017,1,55,"<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p><em><strong>One thing that I did see was that the closed questions, also seem to get automatically deleted. This is a shame because some of them have interesting/informative answers. So this raises the question that whilst, yeah, close the obvious shopping answers, should the associated information/knowledge that resides in the answers be lost, or not displayed, because the question was auto-deleted? Is there a close-but-don't-delete flag?</strong></em></p>
<hr />
<h3>Preamble</h3>
<p><em>Admittedly, this is a bit of a slippery slope, and I certainly am <strong>not</strong> advocating that all closed questions get re-opened but I was going through [some of] the closed questions last night and it is a shame that a few were closed due to the narrow (maybe strict?) guide lines that were set initially. If I get time, I might add a new section to the meta post, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276"">Game plan - What is on-topic?</a>, for new topics pulled from some select closed questions.</em></p>
<h3>Beachcombing the closed question pile</h3>
<p>I have been browsing a number of <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=closed%3Ayes"">closed questions</a> and came across a lot of &quot;Best first printer&quot; type questions, which are off-topic, admittedly, but they had some good answers. I think those sorts of questions get people to want to answer, for whatever reason (pride/emotion in demonstrating their own first printer, good/bad experiences, what have you...). Maybe, instead of closing <em>all</em> of them, it is worth having just one example question, such as the example below, so that it <em>has already</em> been asked - then we can legitimately close subsequent similar duplicates, without any loss of information or help.</p>
<p>Taking this one as an example, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer"">https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5836/whats-the-least-amount-of-money-i-can-spend-to-get-a-decent-printer</a>. It was closed as being too broad. I actually voted to close it as well, although I'm starting to wish that I hadn't. It has some great answers in it and it is a shame that they have been lost.</p>
<p>Since having been closed, it has now been <em>automatically deleted</em>. I'm just wondering whether it is worth undeleting it..?</p>
<p>I am not 100% sure whether, after undeleting it, then leaving it closed will cause it to be automatically deleted again - isn't there some sort of <em>closed-but-don't-delete</em> flag?</p>
<p>If there isn't then would it also have to be re-opened? Which, of course, entails other issues of &quot;Why do we allow certain broad questions to be left open?&quot; or &quot;It's a shopping question!&quot;</p>
<p>Regardless, it <em>does</em> seem a shame to have lost those fine (but subjective) answers.</p>

<li>Have you done some research before asking the question? <sup>1</sup></li>

<li>Have you specified which software you're using, including version number where relevant?</li>

<li>created a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve"">Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example</a>? <sup>2</sup></li>
</ul></li>
<li>If your 3D printer produces results which are different to what you expect, have you stated what you expected, why you expected it, and what your actual results were?</li>
<li>Have you checked that your question looks reasonable in terms of formatting?</li>
<li>Have you checked the spelling and grammar to the best of your ability? <sup>3</sup></li>
<li>Have you read the whole question to yourself carefully, to make sure it makes sense and contains enough information for someone coming to it without any of the context that you already know?</li>
</ul>

<p>If the answer to any of these questions is ""no"" then please take the time to fix up your question before posting, by going through this list. While we understand this may seem like a lot of effort, it will help you to get a useful answer as quickly as possible; and you might even solve your problem yourself in the process! <sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Don't forget that you're basically asking other people to help you out of the goodness of their heart - it's up to you to do all you can to make that as simple as possible.</p>

The first 2 were <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/22246/personal-manufacturing"">Personal Manufacturing</a>(before my time) and <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/41850/digital-fabrication"">Digital Fabrication</a>(I tried and failed).</p>

<p>So my question is that, is it possible to expand the scope of the 3DPrinting SE to a more general scope, in particularly 3D Milling, given that a LOT of the underlying tech IS shared?</p>

<p>I am asking this because a lot of the people involved in the first 2 failed proposals are participating here and may be able to help answer my questions (and further, despite the site's title, this <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/143/150"">answer</a> advises a more inclusive approach).</p>

<p>I mean that if, in order to print Material X on my printer, I need to print at 30mm/s with a temperature of 220°C and an enclosure, it is highly unlikely than another printer can do it without the enclosure, at 80mm/s with a temperature of 190°C. (Those are completely random numbers.)</p>

<p>Materials behave similarly no matter the printer, thus such advice might help people and draw some more people in as those Q&amp;A would appear on Google searches.</p>

I left work for the day without clicking send on my comment, or my answer, and found today that it had closed, locked, and rejected. A comment said it should be rejected for being a hardware recommendation question.  Ultimately it was closed for being off topic.</p>

<p>IMO, both of these reasons are incorrect, and miss the point of the question.</p>

<p>Yes, the OP admitted that they were facing their conundrum because of a long delay from China, but the question was not about vendor A vs. vendor B.  The question was about what the requirements are for a motor in a particular application.  This was about specifications and parts selection, not, in the sense of I think it was intended, a product selection.</p>

<p>The OP wasn't asking about one 3D printer vs. another, or one system manufacturer vs. another.  The OP was asking which of two motors would be more suitable to the application.  This is engineering, not marketing.  This is education, not shilling a vendor.</p>

<p>As for being ""off-topic"", are we rejecting all questions about components and 3D printer engineering problems?  Have we become strictly a user group for off-the-shelf printing systems?</p>

<p>I feel strongly that this should be the place for discussing 3D printing engineering, and use, and tools.  But, perhaps this interest is unique to me, and I should find somewhere else to interact with 3D printing users who have engineering problems.</p>

<p>Have others noticed that the volume of reddit traffic related to 3D printing has dramatically increased in the last few months.  Has reddit become the preferred place for engineering questions?  </p>

<p>As for the user who had the 3D Printing Beta door slammed in their face, IMO both options they presented were sub-optimal, and by closing the question we can't help them either with the choice, or with understanding why.  </p>

<p>A distinguishing characteristic of these sites is how they are moderated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br>
  -- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>While there certainly are <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">Moderators</a> here, a significant amount of the <em>moderation</em> is done by ordinary people, using the privileges 
they've earned by virtue of their contributions to the site. Each of you contributes a little bit of time and effort, and together you accomplish much.</p>

<p>As we enter a new year, let's pause and reflect, taking a moment to appreciate the work that we do here together. 
And what could be more festive than a big pile of numbers? 
So here is a breakdown of moderation actions performed on 3D Printing over the past 12 months:</p>

<p>¹ ""Community"" here refers both to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users"">the membership of 3D Printing</a> <em>without</em> <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators"">diamonds next to their names</a>, and to the automated systems otherwise known as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/-1"">user #-1</a>.</p>

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>

<p>³ A ""destroyed"" user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>

<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>

<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>

<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>

<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).   </p>

494,1,2020-09-13T19:05:49.350,4,59,"<p>I've been here for a little while.  I am still a low-reputation of SE, with most of my involvement being here.  I know that each SE has it's own personality, somewhat derived from the charter, somewhat from the written standards, and somewhat determined by the customary practices in the community.</p>
<p>I have found from reading many answers that the first line is often &quot;soft&quot;.  A welcome to a new user.  A word of appreciation for the question.  A social throat-clearing before jumping into the substance of the answer.  Over time, I have adopted this form myself, especially with a user who is new to 3D Printing SE.</p>
<p>Three days ago, one of my answers was edited to remove the preliminary social lubricant.  I'm fine with this, and I understand it is in keeping with the position that the value of SE to the investors is in the responsive content of the answers, not in the social glue.  I would have approved the edits myself except that one can not do that from the app.  Today, I connected through a desktop and found that the edit had been auto-approved.  Again, no problem.</p>
<p>But to the question.</p>
<p>We want to be welcoming to new users, and we hope they will stay close to the site and become active members.  To do so requires communication, the informal, person-to-person communication that builds oxytocin rather than facts.  This doesn't fit the business purpose of SE, but it is necessary to support the mission of SE which must succeed for the business to succeed.</p>
<p>Is the right method to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Welcome people in an answer,</li>
<li>Welcome people in a comment, where it is also not appropriate,</li>
<li>Do not welcome people -- just stick to the facts, or</li>
<li>Welcome people in an answer but go back later and strip it out?</li>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the past 12 months</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we welcome 2021, and in keeping with tradition, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pU1Al.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<blockquote>
<p>Hi and welcome to SE.3DP! Unfortunately, your answer does not answer the question. Without wishing to sound harsh, StackExchange is a Q&amp;A site, and not a forum of threaded messages. The reason for this is to aid the search for answers to issues, and provide it in a structured Q&amp;A way. I know that this might seem a pain, but can you repost your question using the Ask Question link at the top of the page? When you repost your new question, please feel free to refer back to this original question using the URL, seeing as it is the reason why you posted in the first place</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, they don't seem to ever re-post their query as a question.</p>
<p>So, my point is, should we:</p>
<ol>
<li>Convert the answer into a comment so that someone can answer them (also via a comment);</li>
<li>Leave the answer as is (so that someone can answer them (also via a comment)), or;</li>
<li>Continue deleting and leaving the standard comment.</li>
</ol>
<p>Points 1 and 2 are both against SE policy, and would turn the Q&amp;A format into a forum of threaded messages, so point 3 would be the correct &quot;SE way&quot; of doing things. However, it does also mean that these new users:</p>
<ol>
<li>Don't get any help, and;</li>
<li>Seem to get scared off.</li>
</ol>
<p>Any ideas how to fix this? Or am I worrying too much?</p>
<p>I guess a user with enough rep could (if they know the answer), briefly undelete the answer, leave a comment as to provide a solution, and then re-delete it. However, this is a double edged sword: this wouldn't encourage the new user to post their own question, although it would give them the help that they need. Also, not only does it encourage bad SE etiquette, we probably don't have enough users with sufficient rep to do this.</p>
<p>Another way of looking at it is that, if the new user <em>really</em> needs help then they <em>will</em> post their own question, and if they don't post one, then they weren't all that desperate, after all.</p>

<p>Many questions are actually <a href=""/q/83/"">troubleshooting questions</a>. You may try to answer them to unblock the concerned who stuck, but number of possible causes, which mean many degrees of freedom... so sometimes you can only guess. Also about skills of the asking person (sign me up). Definitely nothing to complain about, there is learning curve and its laws. But these guess-answers will often lead to:</p>
<ul>
<li>opening an discussion in comments, not very promising because of limited and not-so-interactive nature of comments,</li>
<li>abandoning the question by disheartened user, who may find it too hard, misleading, or even <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/28/answers-that-dont-answer-the-question"">not answering the question</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>So:</p>
<ol>
<li><p><strong>Should we propose a chat</strong> to discuss doubts and do troubleshooting, when comments start growing? Is it accepted practice in the process? Is it good in your opinion?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Troubleshooting is very specific and rather short-living discussion. <strong>What chat room to use the best?</strong> I suppose that creating new room for each issue should be avoided. So far I could not learn the real nature of <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room"">Public 3D Printing Room</a> (yet?), but to me it seems proper for higher-level subjects (of some wider use, for community, etc.).</p>
<p>So maybe it would be better to have a separate chat(s) for ad hoc troubleshooting. Maybe to revitalize <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/the-hotbed-3d-printing"">The Hotbed</a> for such purpose? This name even sounds appropriate for all the urgency and surgery ;)</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the question contents sounds more like panic button press, rather than effect of understanding to the reasonable limits with conscious research, should we propose <strong>switching to chat immediately</strong> instead of throwing hints and discouraging prompts? I am aware that few of us is going to assist for longer period, but still it more transparent and better then in comments, and there is a change for more people to join in and even take over the subject. Great chance to mix skills and specialities, instead of trying to offer half-answers.</p>
</li>
<li><p>More interactive approach would lead to more successful answers. This will help growing this community by having <strong>more users coming back</strong>, with increasing awareness - I suppose this is key factor. It's easier to summarize results of colloquial chat as a question improvement or as an answer, than write literary paragraph with all possibly important details (and then you have to read all of it back and forth). It would be also more convenient to remind of accepting answers or even voting due to gratitude - which made in comments seems to have an opposite effect (sometimes like admonishing; lifeless automated reminders work much better for such reasons).</p>

<p>We are a smallish site, with a smallish number of active users (although it isn't <em>that</em> small, and is slowly growing over time, it should be noted). We don't have a problem with review queues building up <em>except</em> with the close votes. Some questions do seem to hang around for a while in the close queue.</p>
<p>The problem with the close vote review queue requiring 5 votes when there is a <em>limited</em> number of active reviewers (where two of which are moderators) is this: If a moderator votes, then the question is automatically closed, even if there aren't 5 votes - if a moderator casts the first vote to close then the question is closed straight away, without waiting for another four votes - so the vote is not democratic, but instead, dictatorial in nature. As such, moderators tend to not vote, unless the question blatantly needs closing (i.e. spam, vulgarity, etc.).</p>
<p>There are ways around this problem:</p>
<ul>
<li>sock puppets (moderators have a fake account to cast votes only in the review queue), or;</li>
<li>waiting for four votes and then a moderator casting the fifth vote (or waiting for three votes and then moderators agreeing (behind the scenes) to cast the final two votes, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, these aren't ideal, and just shortening the queue might make things better. This need not be a permanent change, I guess, so if this site, for some reason, eventually exploded in popularity, the review queue <em>could</em> go back to five votes (but I'm not 100 % sure about that, see the SE.Meta post above to check).</p>
<p>So... should SE.3DP jump on the &quot;three votes to close&quot; train? Or are things OK as they are? What do other users think? <em>Please</em> leave a comment or answer.</p>
<p>To make things super simple, and if you don't have time to write a comment or answer, you can just vote on the <strong>Yes</strong> answer or the <strong>No</strong> answer.</p>
<h3>End of voting date</h3>
<p>To give this vote an end point, and not make it so opened-ended, I guess we should tally a &quot;final&quot; vote on the 1<sup>st</sup> July 2021 - which is May 6 (trial start date) plus 45 days (length of trial) plus a little bit more. As we can't join the trial halfway through, there isn't much point to tallying up the votes before that.</p>

<p>However... whilst it is obvious (to most people) which flags apply to which answers - when those answers are really just comments and those answers that are just gibberish - I've never totally and fully understood the subtle difference between <strong>Not an answer</strong> and <strong>Low quality answer</strong>, with respect to the queues and the flags that the moderators see. This following post goes some way to explaining the difference.</p>
<p><em>This is copied verbatim from <a href=""https://meta.askubuntu.com/q/19430/348964"">Please don't flag link-only answers as Very Low Quality</a></em></p>
<hr />
<blockquote>
<p>Lately I notice that many link-only (or link-mainly) answers are being
flagged as Very Low Quality, so I am taking to meta to ask y'all to
use the Not An Answer flag for link-only answer (LOA) posts instead.</p>
<p>I realise that the phrase &quot;very low quality&quot; is incredibly vague and
open to endless interpretation, but the flag called Very Low Quality
is only to be used for posts which are incoherent and <strong>not
salvageable by editing</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, it's true that most of <a href=""https://askubuntu.com/help/deleted-answers"">the posts we consider Not An Answer</a>,
such as answers thanking other answers, answers that say &quot;I have the
same problem; have you solved it yet?&quot; and so on, are not salvageable
by editing.</p>
<p>But there is one category of Not An Answer post that is fairly likely
to be salvageable by editing, and that is link-only answers. Many new
users, when prompted by a comment, will go ahead and expand their
answer to include details from a link, and other users might be able
and willing to edit such posts into shape themselves (I do it pretty
frequently). It's not always appropriate to edit link-only answers
(for instance, there may be copyright issues if we reproduce material
from outside sources) but quite often it is, and editing might
sometimes even make them good, upvoteable answers.</p>
<p>Now, you may well be thinking at this point that I'm being pedantic.
Who cares what the flag is called as long as the post gets the correct
treatment, right? The reason I care a lot about this is that the Very
Low Quality flag has a really interesting &quot;feature&quot;, which is that any
action, except deletion, that resolves such a flag cast on an answer
as helpful, will automatically cast a downvote on that answer. And for
some reason, editing a post flagged Very Low Quality resolves that
flag as helpful (even though the flag is supposed to be raised on
posts that are not salvageable by editing) (this includes when the
author edits) (this isn't the case for Not An Answer flags, by the
way). So on those not-infrequent occasions when I find an answer
flagged Very Low Quality (link-only or not) that I want to fix by
editing, I have to do one of these things to avoid it being
automatically downvoted:</p>
<ul>
<li>delete the post (resolves the flag as helpful), undelete it and edit it (if it was flaggable)</li>
<li>decline the flag, and then edit the post (if the answer wasn't flaggable at all in my opinion)</li>
</ul>
<p>I don't mind doing that, but, sometimes I forget to do it and edit
first and the post gets downvoted. Ugh. Or someone else edits the post
first (probably the author, poor soul), and it gets downvoted. Ugh. Or
another mod dismisses the flag as helpful without deleting it because,
although it's relying quite heavily on a link (or for some other
reason was understandably flagged) it's actually not a link-only
answer* (or otherwise deleteable), and it gets downvoted. Ugh. Nothing
removes those downvotes!</p>
<p><strong>In conclusion, please flag link-only answers as Not An Answer</strong> (unless you can fix them yourself or the author has indicated that
they will do so imminently).</p>
<p><strong>Why is a link-only answer not an answer?</strong> See this Meta Stack Exchange post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/225370/your-answer-is-in-another-castle-when-is-an-answer-not-an-answer"">Your answer is in another castle: when is an answer not
an answer?</a> (ironically I'm relying totally on that link...)</p>
<hr />
<p>*<strong>When is a link-only answer not Not An Answer, and what is a link-only answer anyway?</strong></p>
<p>A link-only answer is one that is not useful at all without the link.
Sometimes answers that are useful without the link(s) they contain are
flagged, but should not be. For example, an answer that gives a
<em>specific, relevant recommendation</em>, even if it's very short, and includes a link that gives a step-by-step procedure to follow that
recommendation, is not a link-only answer, because it's still useful
without the link. Such answers can very often be improved, of course,
by adding some version of the step-by-step procedure.</p>
<p>There are very rare occasions when a link-only answer is an answer and
should not be flagged. Sometimes, the question asks for something
which cannot practically be included in the post. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I need a driver for this thingy I have</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>There is a driver for your thingy <code>[in this repository](URL)</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, some installation instructions would be good, but we can't put
the driver itself in the post, so this type of answer should not
generally be flagged or deleted (commenting or editing or downvoting
may be appropriate though).</p>

<p>We as a community have done pretty well at this. We've got over 5000 visits per day of which 2000 are new visitors. In the meta post <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/264/what-does-it-take-to-get-out-of-beta-stage"">What does it take to get out of Beta stage?</a> we've tried to explain the progress on the Beta stage. Apart from the minimum questions per day (10 questions per day metric) we're doing quite well for the classic criteria for graduation (note that the smaller SE sites have difficulties to comply to this requirement).</p>
<p>We've got a good understanding of what's <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic and what's not</a>.
Most of our tags have detailed tag wiki excerpts, explaining how and why they should be used.
Us Pro-Tempore Moderators are doing less work due to our active <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users"">users</a> (thank you!). What we still need to work on is <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=Voters&amp;filter=year"">voting</a>, see <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote"">Remember to vote!</a>.</p>
<h2>What graduation means</h2>
<p>There are several aspects to graduation. These used to be bundled together as an all-or-nothing thing, but they <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/303727/lets-break-up-with-graduation-and-remove-a-bunch-of-beta-labels"">aren't any more</a>. This means:</p>
<ul>
<li>Losing the beta label (yes! 16th December 2021, give or take)
<ul>
<li>&quot;Graduated&quot; on <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing"">our Area 51 page</a></li>
<li>Removing the “Site Stats” and “Help us grow this site!” boxes shown to anonymous users.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Moderator elections (2022 or 2023)</li>
<li>Migration paths, maybe, if we ask for them.</li>
</ul>
<p>But we won't have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased reputation thresholds</li>
<li><a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/263905/design-independent-graduation-is-on-for-early-september"">Custom site design</a> (but we might get minor customization)</li>
</ul>
<h2>How we can prepare</h2>
<p>If you think we shouldn't graduate, for whatever reason, please say so: there's still time to slam on the brakes.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we don't really need to do anything. If you want to, though, here are some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write tag wiki excerpts for every single <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags"">tag</a>. I think this is achievable, even for weird tags like <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support</a>, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/dimensional-accuracy"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;dimensional-accuracy&#39;"" rel=""tag"">dimensional-accuracy</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/chamber"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;chamber&#39;"" rel=""tag"">chamber</a> to name a few.</li>
<li>Write some basic (<a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/knowledgebase"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;knowledgebase&#39;"" rel=""tag"">knowledgebase</a>) Q&amp;A pairs, or edit/tag existing questions into such. (New-ish users: you're the best for this. If you have had a question about how the site works, chances are it's FAQ-worthy.)</li>
<li>Answer some <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/unanswered"">unanswered questions</a> or vote to close if appropriate.</li>
<li>Start thinking of questions for our first moderator election. Also consider who you might want to nominate, and whether you might want to nominate yourself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Lastly, visit our <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room"">public 3D printing chat room</a> for some on- and off-topic conversations!</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2021, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/KZntT.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes).</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I printed a crane mechanism in 3D. How much voltage must I apply to the motor to lift 150 grams?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I see this type of thing all the time. Users will go to the mat arguing that they are printing in 3D, so their question is on topic. It is not. The actual <em>expertise</em> needed to answer this question is in electronics. With a question like this, the premise that the user <em>happens</em> to be printing in 3D is entirely coincidental to the actual issue. </p>

<p>The examples you cited above are a bit more iffy. I might argue some of them could (potentially) be on topic&hellip; if the issue of the material being printed in 3D is somehow germane to the problem. I actually don't know enough about the subject to say, so I'm only considering the possibility that it <em>is</em> relevant to this subject space.</p>

<p>Let's not be too quick to start barring questions that aren't explicitly about the physical process of 3D printing literally. There are a lot of <em>industry issues</em> that could be interesting to include here. It's probably better to <strong><em>wait for actual examples before trying to create a general rule around this issue.</em></strong></p>

<p>As a general rule for building this site, it is often better to wait for a preponderance of problems that occur <em>in actual practice</em> before we start seeking to create a lot of rules around hypothetical situations. Words to live by.</p>

43,2,2016-01-13T14:27:07.137,1,,"<h3>Technological issues</h3>

<p>Stack Exchange works hard for its communities, but there is a limit. If thingiverse changes its API (which it can, and does, do at any time without notice) then anything we build on it has to be modified, and users will be very whiny until it's fixed.</p>

<p>If we choose to integrate model viewing or any sort of API integration with an outside service, we will have to make sure the service provides some sort of legacy guarantee minimal API that won't change, and then we will only be able to use that.  </p>

<h3>Political issues</h3>

<p>I would be very uncomfortable endorsing a closed source, commercial service on this site.  There are many communities within the world of 3D printing that are very unhappy with makerbot, thingiverse, and their parent company, and encouraging users to use this service may result in pushing away some very valuable experts within the reprap world.</p>

<h3>Looking to the future</h3>

<p>If we integrate any sort of model library or model viewer, I strongly suggest we choose an open source project the community can heartily endorse.  We may link to outside models, but the core API should be servable by stack exchange without license or much maintenance so 1) we don't have to deal with API changes messing us up, 2) we don't rely on outside services that may change their terms of use or API, 3) we don't have to form complicated contract bound relationships with 3rd parties just to get the guarantees we'd need to convince Stack Exchange to invest in a new feature, and 4) we don't become too politically involved such that we disenfranchise users who may have very strong feelings about this subject.</p>

<h3>Wait and see</h3>

<p>This is the early beta.  Let's find out what people link to in questions before dedicating resources to improving the links/plug-ins/oneboxes.  It may be that thingiverse objects are linked to frequently, and that it would add value to the site to improve that experience, but it's also just as likely that thingiverse turns out to be infrequently linked and the effort spent now would essentially have been wasted.  Let's wait until we have tens of thousands of questions so we can properly evaluate what the community actually uses and needs.</p>

45,2,2016-01-13T14:57:44.823,3,,"<p>The ultimate goal of any answer should be to <strong>solve the problem that the asker is facing</strong>. Sometimes that involves not going to what they directly wrote, because sometimes that's not the most effective way to go about it. For much the same as there are people who can't use alternatives, there are people who didn't <em>think</em> about the alternative options in the first place. It's very easy when some askers run into a problem, to tunnel-vision that ""I must solve it this way"" and then someone provides a very enlightening view by working outside the box the asker had situated inside. </p>

<p>That said, this is also part of the very nature as to why these sites permit more than one answer to a question. It is to allow different routes to solve the same problem. Some will be the direct route that is asked, others will take shortcuts as they see fit.</p>

<p>It remains though that naturally, sometimes an alternative, be it a particular one or just in general, is not permissible. When this is the case, that kind of a restriction is <em>part of the problem</em>. As such if the asker can't work with a given alternative, and if the only answers they're getting is that alternative, it's to them to modify their question to exclude that alternative as an option. Or if it is a known quantity to begin with, a pre-emptitive exclusion present in the question when asked is very appropriate. On the other side, if a reader happens upon a question and cannot utilize the alternatives that exist there, then they are welcome to recreate the question in a fashion which excludes the alternatives since their situation cannot cater to it.</p>

<p>Sans such an explicit exclusion, if the asker can work with the alternative, or if they still receive other answers that do not employ that alternative, there's no foul going on as a result. It's fine to dislike something being provided as an alternative, but it's by no means something we're going to discourage on a level to the point of flagging. Downvotes, those are yours to give as you see fit to things that you believe are not helpful - I could say something like ""It's probably more appropriate to downvote if a particular alternative is actively unhelpful to you, as opposed to a post which you stumble across in random browsing which just <em>happens</em> to be an alternative"", but at the same vein, you could still deem it unhelpful and the vote is yours to cast. Just be open to the fact that if the alternative <em>does</em> work for other people, it's going to remain acceptable on the site.</p>

<p>First, overlap between sites is fine. <em>It doesn't matter if a question is on topic somewhere else</em>; that's no reason to eliminate it from a different site's scope. There were some issues when HSM sprang up, because Mathematics, Physics, and other sites allowed history-related questions. I participated in several meta discussions on these sites. While Physics eventually decided to not allow history questions, Mathematics and other sites continued to allow them. So we should not make our decision based on Law.</p>

<p>I do agree that, so far, the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;legal&#39;"" rel=""tag"">legal</a> questions have not been great.

<blockquote>
  <p>I agree with @TomvanderZanden; a good case could be made for keeping this here. Laws and regulations can be a huge influence on an industry; the allowance or ban of certain products of said industry would seem to be relevant here. Remember, questions can be on-topic on multiple sites.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Regulatory measures can be extraordinarily important in a industry. If we had a site about making socks, should questions about whether or not is is legal to make socks with material X in the United States be off topic? I would argue no; this could be an important part of sock-making.</p>

Some <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/legal"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;legal&#39;"" rel=""tag"">legal</a> questions can be important; I would argue that questions regarding which materials and devices are legal should be ones we aim for.

<li>I deleted my answer.</li>
<li>I edited it.</li>
<li>There was continued dialogue with the user and another. I improved my answer even further.</li>
<li>Downvote was removed.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm grateful to the downvoter, and to the comments. We need to establish what posts are good and bad in the site, and my original answer was not good.

<p>We should definitely upvote. But downvoting is good, too. Downvoters don't have to comment - that's never the case - but comments certainly help. They helped me.</p>

<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks — folks like you. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference in ensuring Stack Exchange sites remain a valuable source of high-quality content on the web.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2023 (and January 2024… ahem) and move into 2024, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/pmN7M.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>³ The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>⁴ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁵ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁶ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes). The community² can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.</p>
<p>⁷ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁸ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

<p>I think migration (also from other sites) is perhaps the most effective for multiple reasons. As I believe the user is notified, also more relevant content is available on this site making it easier found when using search engines. What are your thoughts on this, why isn't this community bigger and more active, did it used to be, what was already tried?</p>

<p>The middle sidebar ads have the same standards as any other ads on the platform. Ads are non-intrusive and static. Ads go through a vetting process to ensure they are appropriate for the communities on Stack Exchange. If you see an ad that may not follow our established standards and guidelines, you can let us know by using the &quot;<strong>report this ad</strong>&quot; functionality.

<p>I wanted to add excerpt to another tag, but it looks like there is no template for it. Each tag is written differently and it looks a bit messy. In addition, in many cases, tag excerpt is too long.</p>
<p>I have already read <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/help/tag-excerpts"">What should a tag wiki excerpt contain?</a>, but I would also like to know what should be the template for a tag excerpt?</p>

<ol>
<li>Mis-spelt - missing an &quot;e&quot;</li>
<li>It is almost illegible (i.e. difficult to read)</li>
<li>No hyphens - shouldn't it be hyphenated, like this: <code>[automatic-bed-leveling]</code>?</li>
</ol>
<p>It only has two questions tagged with it (so far).</p>

<p>Note: I don't believe that it should be abbreviated, or become an acronym, such as <code>[abl]</code>, because no one would probably be able to find it (unless they already knew that it existed or it was made into a synonym)... but maybe I am wrong..? That is to say, it seems much more natural to start typing &quot;autom...&quot; when looking for a tag relating to automatic bed leveling - I certainly would <em>not</em> type &quot;abl&quot; if looking for the tag.</p>

<p>As we say goodbye to the old year and welcome the new one, we have <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/search?q=%22year+in+moderation%22+is%3Aquestion"">a tradition of sharing moderation stats for the preceding calendar year</a>.</p>
<p>As most of you here are aware, sites on the Stack Exchange network are moderated somewhat differently to other sites on the web:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We designed the Stack Exchange network engine to be mostly self-regulating, in that we amortize the overall moderation cost of the system across thousands of teeny-tiny slices of effort contributed by regular, everyday users.<br />
-- <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/"">A Theory of Moderation</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That doesn't eliminate the need for having <a href=""https://stackoverflow.blog/2018/11/21/our-theory-of-moderation-re-visited/"">moderators</a> altogether, but it does mean that the bulk of moderation work is carried out by regular folks. Every bit of time and effort y'all contribute to the site gives you access to more privileges you can use to help in this effort, all of which produce a cumulative effect that makes a big difference.</p>
<p>So as we say goodbye to 2022 (and where did January go, right?) and dive head first into 2023, let us look back at what we accomplished as a community... by looking at some <a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/V0TPg.gif"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><em>exciting</em> stats</a>.

<p>¹ &quot;Community&quot; here refers both to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users"">the membership of 3D Printing</a> <em>without</em> <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users?tab=moderators"">diamonds next to their names</a>, and to the automated systems otherwise known as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/-1"">user #-1</a>.</p>
<p>² The system will suspend users under three circumstances: when a user is recreated after being previously suspended, when a user is recreated after being destroyed for spam or abuse, and when a network-wide suspension is in effect on an account.</p>
<p>³ A &quot;destroyed&quot; user is deleted along with all that they had posted: questions, answers, comments. <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/88994/what-is-the-difference-between-a-deleted-user-and-a-destroyed-user"">Generally used as an expedient way of getting rid of spam.</a></p>
<p>⁴ This counts every review that was submitted (not skipped) - so the 2 suggested edits reviews needed to approve an edit would count as 2, the goal being to indicate the frequency of moderation actions. This also applies to flags, etc.</p>
<p>⁵ Includes close flags (but <em>not</em> close or reopen votes). Community can handle these flags by at least one person voting to close a question that has a close flag.</p>
<p>⁶ This ignores numerous deletions that happen automatically in response to some other action.</p>
<p>⁷ This includes comments deleted by their own authors (which also account for some number of handled comment flags).</p>

<p>However, if the question is purely about how to draw/design something, without it needing to be printed, where can a user ask these questions, if they are off-topic here? That is to say, where can the user be pointed to? Which Stack Exchange site?</p>

504,1,2021-01-17T17:24:36.930,1,38,"<p>This is a quick note to say that the (yawn!) <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic page</a> has been fixed up and made to look like the on-topic pages of other SE sites, rather than a jumbled beta mess (which was entirely my fault after my previous patch, I must admit). As we aren't really a <em>beta</em>-beta site any more (but rather more one of those perpetual beta sites) it seemed sensible to tidy it up.</p>
<p>Also, a recent <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/15335/4762"">CAD question</a> raised some issues with the on-topic page, for not being particularly clear.</p>
<p>Obviously, it can still change a bit, and any suggestions or corrections will be <em>whole-heartedly</em> welcomed.</p>
<p>Personally, I feel that the off-topic section doesn't seem prominent enough to me, but it has the same &quot;format&quot; as the other sites have. However, the other sites don't have such a massive list of on-topic as us - their on- and off-topic sections are <em>roughly</em> the same size, whereas our off-topic section is about 5 % the size of our on-topic section. Hence why the off-topic section seems to be invisible, stuck down right at the bottom.</p>
<p>Also, the only weird bit left now is the large block of waffly <code>&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;</code> text. Firstly, links don't seem to work within that block, for some reason, so I stripped them out. Secondly, some of the waffle needs to go.</p>
<p>Apart from that... &quot;Mission Accomplished&quot;?</p>

<h3>Obvious mistakes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Typos</li>
<li>Spelling:
<ul>
<li>commonly used 3d -&gt; <a href=""https://www.lexico.com/definition/3d"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">3D</a>;</li>
<li>proper capitalizing:
<ul>
<li>printer/electronics make and model like:
<ul>
<li>ramps -&gt; RAMPS,</li>
<li>ender -&gt; Ender,</li>
<li>bltouch -&gt; BLTouch, etc.;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>software products like:
<ul>
<li>cura -&gt; Cura,</li>
<li>octoprint -&gt; OctoPrint,</li>
<li>pronterface -&gt; Pronterface</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Others:
<ul>
<li>gcode / g-code -&gt; G-code;</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grammar.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Salutations</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removal of signatures;</li>
<li>Removal of greetings, such as &quot;Hi&quot;/&quot;Hi there&quot;;</li>
<li>Removal of 'Hope this helps' - &quot;<em>Stack Overflow is like an encyclopedia, so we prefer to omit these types of phrases. It is assumed that everyone here is trying to be helpful.</em>&quot; - I saw this quote on SO.</li>
<li>Removal of &quot;Thanks&quot; - this is both contentious and up-for-debate on some SE sites. However, if you agree with the above quote for &quot;Hope this helps&quot;, then the same can be applied to &quot;Thanks&quot; - it can be assumed that you will be grateful - also &quot;Thanks&quot; reduces the encyclopedia &quot;look&quot; of SE.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Correct use of SI units</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>SI units are the standard <em>(Imperial units can be used as secondary units but should be put in between parentheses after the SI units)</em>;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Adding non-breaking space before SI units (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code>) - see <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/297/4762"">Don't forget the space!</a>;</p>
</li>
<li><p>Temperature units:</p>
<ul>
<li>Celsius: c or C or oC -&gt; °C (<code>&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;C</code>)</li>
<li>Fahrenheit: f or F or oF -&gt; °F (<code>&amp;nbsp;&amp;deg;F</code>)</li>
<li>Kelvin: k -&gt; K (<code>&amp;nbsp;K</code>) [No degree sign!]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Electrical <strong>units</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Voltage</a>/Volt: v -&gt; V;</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_current"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Current</a>/Ampere: a -&gt; A;</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_resistance_and_conductance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Resistance</a>: Ohms -&gt; Ω (<code>&amp;Omega;</code>)</li>
<li><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_power"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Power</a>: Watt -&gt; w -&gt; W</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Electrical science uses a set of nigh <strong>universal variables</strong> when writing down formulas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Voltage/Potential Difference: U/V</li>
<li>Current/Flow: I</li>
<li>Resistance: R</li>
<li>Power: P</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Presentation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Break up walls of text, into more easily digestible paragraphs;</li>
<li>Replace slang, or <em>text-speak</em>, with grammatical English;</li>
<li>Possible re-arranging of text blocks, into a more logical, or clearer, sequence - if, for example, the post (usually an initially poor quality question) has slowly been built through a series of edits responding to repeated requests for additional information. However, care should be taken not to cause a conflict with the author's intent - respect the OP.</li>
<li>Remove instances of &quot;EDIT:&quot; and the such like (e.g. date and time stamps). There is already a link to the edit history of the post, which viewable by all, so there really is no need to replicate this in the text - it just disrupts the readability and flow of text.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Text formatting</h3>
<ul>
<li>Removing HTML tags (i.e. <code>&lt;br&gt;</code>) when there is a markdown equivalent;</li>
<li>List formatting, and associated additional indenting of linked paragraphs and code;</li>
<li>Quotes must be <em>blockquote formatted</em> <strong>and</strong> have the source provided, preferably as a link. This is to avoid accusations of plagiarism and possible legal action.</li>
<li>Code formatting: G-codes should be <em>code formatted</em>, i.e. surrounded by backquotes (`), indented by 4 spaces or (for multiple lines) enclosed by triple single backquotes (```).</li>
</ul>
<h3>Images</h3>
<ul>
<li>Image descriptions, <em>and</em> image hover tags (see <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/588/4762"">this answer</a> for an example);</li>
<li>Clickable image display - i.e. <code>[![&lt;imagedescription&gt;][x]][x]</code>, sometimes, somehow, the &quot;outside&quot; wrapper brackets get lost;</li>
<li>Orientation of image - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;</li>
<li>Appropriate size of image, crop out excess white border surrounds - requires a bit of &quot;manual&quot; labour in an image editor;</li>
<li>Ensure that the image has been added to the <em>Stack Exchange</em> imgur, rather than just the vanilla imgur, or an external site, as this reduces the chance of an image disappearing, due to <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">link-rot</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Inlining links</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inlining links with the title of the linked page;</li>
<li>Inlining YouTube links with the title of video.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Title</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't forget to check the title, for spelling, etc., it can be easy to just focus on the body of the question, and overlook the title itself;</li>
<li>Title case should be replaced by regular case, i.e. &quot;This Is Very Ugly To Deal With&quot;;</li>
<li>Remove any information, already present in the tags, which is repeated in the title. For example, if the title is &quot;Filament - Is PETG more weather resistant than PLA?&quot;, the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/filament"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;filament&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;filament&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-filament-tooltip-container"">filament</a> tag can be used instead, and the redundant &quot;Filament&quot; can be removed from the title<sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information from comments</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often there is a large amount of additional information in the comments beneath a post, in response to requests from other users. This additional information <em>really</em> should be in the post itself.  The comment should be copy/pasted into the post and tidied, if necessary.</li>
<li>Once the edit has been approved, the comment should then be flagged as &quot;It's no longer needed&quot;</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>There are probably more examples, so this list may get updated from time to time.</p>

<h3>Footnotes</h3>
<p><sup>1</sup> I wrote this post as one central post doesn't seem to exist. There is a series of disparate meta posts (either on this meta, or other meta sites, or the main <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com"">SE.Meta</a> site), each dealing with one of the different facets of post editing, listed above, which I'll get around to posting links to.

<p>From SuperUser - <a href=""https://meta.superuser.com/questions/13646/editing-of-recently-closed-questions"">Editing of recently closed questions</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This post is basically to share something I came across on Meta Unix &amp;
  Linux. Kusalananda♦, a moderator there, posted <a href=""https://unix.meta.stackexchange.com/q/5319/85417"">Editing questions
  recently put on hold (don't)</a>. The gist is something that I don't
  think is common knowledge, and it would be beneficial to apply the
  same logic here.</p>
  
  <p>It is common knowledge that editing an on-hold post automatically
  bumps it into the Reopen review queue. But there are two factors that
  may not be common knowledge:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>That only happens within the first five days of closure.</li>
  <li>It only happens once.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>There are a number of implications.</p>
  
  <ol>
  <li><p>The five day limitation means that you can <strong>time your minor edits</strong> on closed posts so they don't unnecessarily force wasteful
  reviews. If you want to do tag cleanup or make minor English or
  formatting fixes that don't address the closure issue, wait until
  after the five days.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you edit and fix the closure issue on a question closed more than five days, you need to <strong>also vote to reopen</strong> to get it into the
  queue.</p></li>
  <li><p>The bumping happening only once was the impetus for Kusalananda♦'s post. If you edit the recently closed post to do minor polish that
  doesn't solve the closure issue, that bumps it to the Reopen review
  queue where it will waste a bunch of reviewers' time and won't result
  in it being reopened. But that also <strong>uses up the one automatic
  bump</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>Then, when the OP or another user actually fixes the post, that
  will not bump it into the review queue. Unless someone explicitly
  jump-starts the review process by voting to reopen the question (which
  typically isn't a requirement), the post will remain closed and
  potentially be deleted, even though it's been turned into an
  acceptable question.</p></li>
  <li><p>If you are going to fix a recently closed question, make sure you <strong>fix every issue</strong>. Questions often have multiple problems and just one may be stated as the close reason. Review the question to identify
  everything that is a potential close reason, and address them all.
  Otherwise, you might fix only one of the problems and the question
  will not be reopened due to the remaining problems. That puts it right
  back at point #3.</p></li>
  </ol>
  
  <p><strong>Bottom line</strong>: if a question is recently closed, do not edit it until after the five days unless the edit will solve all closure
  issues.</p>

<pre><code>either an option, or a suggested path
</code></pre>

<p>Yet the whole basis behind making all posts on SE <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/109786/"">cc by-sa 3.0</a> is to make it easy and clear that posts <em>will</em> be <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/120576"">edited to improve the content of the site</a>. </p>

<p>We might have a problem here with <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/111"">closing or locking too many questions</a>, discussed early on in the history of this site. It is easy for users to pile in on top of a downvote or close vote, and to justify this as keeping the site content of high quality. For sure, we don't want to be a repository of badly written 'fix my printer' posts.</p>

<p>On the IoT site (also in Beta, and with a fairly small core of engaged users), we made a deliberate effort to <a href=""https://iot.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/190"">improve questions</a> which were initially closed, once the OP had been given some time to make their own edits. This was quite an interesting challenge, since it helps in thinking what the really useful question to have asked would be. Overall, it improves the number of questions (and thus the reach of the site when it comes to organic search). It keeps the active users engaged in proposing edits, it generates more answers to be upvoted. If the OP comes back to ask another question in 6 months time (after their mini rage-quit), they might be pleasantly surprised to have gained some upvotes or answers.</p>

<p>Clearly not all bad questions are good candidates for improvement. Anything that has some technique/skill aspects (not just troubleshooting) is worth trying to rescue. First with specific directive comments, then with an edit. Where the problem is more along the lines of language or punctuation, I tend to edit by example (and re-structuring a question is also easier to explain with an edit - just encourage the use of rollback).</p>

<p>A critical detail from this <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/113/4927"">answer</a>, when a user is inexperienced with the technology, they will not know the terminology and they will not understand how to ask about their <em>underlying problem</em> rather than what they <em>think they need</em> to do to fix it. We can help this with some signpost or 'duplicate target' types of question.</p>

<p>I'm <strong>not</strong> proposing a free for all on off topic or poor questions, just that our resident experts try and see if they can write good questions on presented topics.</p>

<p>Remember, <strong>do not answer a bad question</strong> unless you want to make sure that even after being closed, the question won't be deleted.</p>

332,1,2018-09-03T22:47:48.110,0,30,"<p>There was a previous question suggesting that the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support-materials"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support-materials&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support-materials</a> tags should be merged, and at the time the only response was <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/168/11242"">to keep them distinct</a>. 2 years later, I think it is time to disagree.</p>

<p>I've already found <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/5318"">questions</a> which talk about support material in the abstract sense, of how to slice, rather than the intended use of the tag to identify the specific material used for support. This automatically makes the tags too imprecise to retain.</p>

<p>We should retain the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">support</a> tag, and merge the other two into it, since that covers the whole group of questions cleanly. I don't think we need synonyms, unless the other tags get re-added by users in the future.</p>

<p>I don't think the aim of tags is to generate a complete literal taxonomy of the subject, rather we are trying to define:</p>

<ul>
<li>What subjects are on topic (support certainty is)</li>
<li>How to most usefully group questions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, support (the structure) and the types of material are literally different things,but together they encompasses the topic of support. There is nothing wrong about referring to the specialist filaments as support. It is also misleading to assume that the structure can be discussed in isolation from the potential materials which can be used.</p>

<p>Along the lines of avoiding the highly complex <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/61/4927"">suggested heirarchical filament taxonomy</a>, I think we can best help people to find questions about support by consolidating the questions under a single tag.</p>

<p>I spent some time thinking about questions I have been asked by friends who purchased FDM machines and were starting to undertake their own designs.  In particular, among the engineers I hang with there is a desire for the generally-accepted-as-valid design principles -- the design rules that, when followed, will usually work.  I haven't come across a reference that lays out such rules for FDM printing, and so I launched a question which someone who knew of such a rule set could answer, or which I could later attempt to answer if a better answer didn't appear.</p>

<p>I asked <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6726/primer-on-3d-printing-design-rules"">this question</a>.</p>

<p>The question drew a ""have you googled that?"" response, coupled with a helpful link.  Other comments ensued, along with two down-votes on the question.</p>

<p>My question here is in two parts:
Is this an appropriate activity -- to ask a question hoping to receive a better answer that I would write myself, and
If the motivation for the question is appropriate, how should the question have been better formed?</p>

<p>After all, over on SE.Arduino, <em>lots</em> of people write ""Arduino UNO"" - I myself did so to, for a long time, until Nick Gammon <a href=""https://arduino.stackexchange.com/questions/13839/can-i-use-analogreadresolution-on-an-uno-or-leonardo#comment25114_13839"">picked me up on it</a>:</p>

Of these, the third is usually curable. And we had the topic of purchasing <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/179/another-approach-to-solving-purchase-questions"">earlier</a>.</p>
<p>But now I want to put attention on a different horse in the room. Purchasing questions. These come actually in quite some different styles!</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;I want to buy X. Where to get it?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I need a model to do X but for [insert reason here] can't make it myself. Is there a model of it?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;I wonder about X. Has anyone encountered X and can review it, so I can make an informed purchase?&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>All these question cores can be called purchasing, but they are also different to some degree. Let's start from the least to the most concerning one:</p>
<p>Question 2 is more a &quot;LMGTFY&quot;. There is a clear best answer, as there might be a model around or someone might make the model for the person asking. Or convert an unprinted model into a printable one. It is somewhat OffTopic for being 3D-design in some instances, but it is OnTopic as we want a 3D printable rendition. So, no problems with these? A little: they often show little to no research effort.</p>
<p>Question 3 is a different kind of horse. Actually it looks more like a Mule than a horse. Well, that is, because it is actually an ass<sup>donkey</sup>. It is not a purchasing question in so much as it is a review request. We had some review guidelines proposed when we last talked about purchasing questions, and they were a solid step, but we might - if this is still OnTopic after this discussion, make a separate meta for those. I deem the possibility of Reviews with a strict guideline OnTopic, as long as:</p>
<ol>

<li><strong>They are not link-only answers.</strong> One might put the full review in a video or link to several reviewers, but one should at least compile the pro/con of the video.</li>
</ol>
<p>Question 1 is the big horse I have trouble seeing OnTopic here: they want a specific answer where to buy/get an object. Suggesting that one specific source might be better than any other would be inappropriate. But we might need to split the hair a little: There are <em>some</em> fringe cases where such a question is answerable, has a best answer and is not open ended when it comes to locating shops or makerspaces, that use the very same question setup (&quot;Is there a makerspace near X/Y/Z?&quot;) And there are questions that are what the RPG-Stack-Exchange calls &quot;Shopping &amp; Recommendation&quot;. They forbid to ask for a recommendation of a specific shop or item over another. We should adhere to that, unless it is one of these &quot;locate a real world place that does X&quot; cases. IMHO we shouldn't  answer to a question like &quot;What is a good first printer?&quot; or &quot;Is there a reputable CR-10 reseller?&quot; or others of these kind. Maybe the fringe case of &quot;Can I buy Printer X at the manufacturer?&quot; is ok too (as it is very specific!), but that is more a sourcing problem, not a purchasing question.</p>
<p>So, in fleshing out our community:</p>
<p><strong>Where do we draw our lines what is In/Out regarding purchasing/acquisition questions? And, do we need to discuss review/sourcing questions?</strong></p>

<p>My reasoning for creating tags for all brands/types is that people that have a problem with their printer search on their printer brand/type and the problem.

<p>I have seen a few (2?) cases where the OP has linked to a video in order to succinctly describe their issue.

<p>Is video inlining disabled on SE.3D Printing, or is it because we are still beta?</p>
<p>If it can be enabled , then should/could it be enabled?</p>

<h2>Let's increase our Visits!</h2>

<p>Ultimately, the kink in the chain is that we do not have enough visitors. The more visitors we accrue, the easier it may become to reach some of these smaller goals such as <strong><em>questions per day</em></strong> and <strong><em>user reputation</em></strong>. Remember that the home page for 3D Printing has sharing links to social media sites.</p>

<p>There are a growing number of 3D printing sites such as Thingiverse, 3D Hubs, MakeXYZ, Shapeways, etc. All of these sites have avid users and I'm sure many of them have questions on a regular basis and are more than happy to share their knowledge with other Makers/Professionals.</p>

<h2>Let's increase our Votes!</h2>

<p>The more people we have visiting the site, the more <strong>opportunity</strong> we have have gaining more reputation.</p>

<p>As Josip Ivic states in a recent <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote"">Meta post</a>, asking/answering questions becomes a chore if people don't feel that they're efforts are appreciated or good enough. Often times there is legitimate research going into answering certain questions, so there can be real work going into providing people with quality answers.</p>

<p>The same goes for asking questions. If you've been in the same predicament or appreciate a well written question, give the question an up-vote.</p>

<h2>Meta Activity</h2>

<p>I think it is also important for everyone to occasionally review the latest here on Meta. It's a great tool for people to express how they feel the site could be better!</p>

Users have fun by earning “hats” for their gravatars by completing certain tasks (very similar to badges). We track everyone’s progress using hats in a leaderboard that looks similar to this:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/OohHZ.jpg"" alt=""hats"" /></a></p>
<p>As always, we’re coming up with new hat designs for this year’s fun!</p>
<p><strong>The Details</strong></p>
<p>The event will run from 19 December 2016 up to and including 08 January 2017. Users will be able to see all the hats they’ve earned on <a href=""http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://winterbash2016.stackexchange.com</a>. That site will also have a landing page, explaining the rules and other details of the event.</p>
<p>Individual users who don’t want to participate, don’t want to see hats, and/or are generally anti-hat will have an “I hate hats” option available. And just like last time, at the end of the event, all hats will go back into storage.</p>
<p>The only visual change to the Stack Exchange sites themselves will be the presence of the hats and the “I hate hats” button in the footer.</p>

192,1,2016-11-27T14:45:32.983,3,46,"<p>I raised a question about heatbed/heated-bed support, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/3097/steel-versus-mdf-aluminium-y-axis-plate"">Steel versus MDF/Aluminium Y axis plate?</a>, and I noticed that there is not yet a heatbed-support tag, so I used <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heatbed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heatbed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heatbed</a>, and also added <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heated-bed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heated-bed</a>, just in case. </p>

<p>However, this raises the question why are there both? <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/heated-bed"">heated-bed</a> has a short but sensible definition, whereas <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/heatbed"">heatbed</a> has no tag definition, so it is unclear the intended difference, if any, in their use. </p>

<p>After a quick search of Meta to see if this issue has already been raised, I, now, see that there is also the tag <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tags/hbp"">hbp</a>, see <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/115/merge-hbp-and-heated-bed-tags"">merge [hbp] and [heated-bed] tags</a>.</p>

<p>For completeness, the respective use of each tag, to date, is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heatbed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heatbed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heatbed</a> 5</li>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heated-bed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heated-bed</a> 34</li>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hbp"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hbp&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hbp</a> 11</li>
</ul>

<p>So these are my questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Should these tags be merged/deleted or left as is? It seems a little confusing, as it stands currently. </li>
<li>Which is the preferred term, <em>heatbed</em>, or <em>heated bed</em>? </li>
<li>Should I add the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hbp"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hbp&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hbp</a> to my question? </li>
<li>Should I remove the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heatbed"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heatbed&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heatbed</a> tag from my question?</li>
<li>With respect to my particular question, should I, also, have created a <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heated-bed-support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heated-bed-support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heated-bed-support</a>, or a <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/heatbed-support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;heatbed-support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">heatbed-support</a> tag, or even a <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/hbp-support"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;hbp-support&#39;"" rel=""tag"">hbp-support</a> tag, so that it is more appropriately tagged?</li>

179,1,2016-07-07T20:54:09.683,3,92,"<p>I originally posted this on Meta StackExchange to judge whether my thoughts fit within SE and have been redirected back to our Meta.</p>

<p>We've received a few questions along the lines of purchasing references since we've opened in Beta. While I personally don't think direct questions about ""<em>What is the best 3D printer to buy?</em>"" are appropriate questions, I'm curious about a potential middle ground.</p>

<p>Should we consider including tags such as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printer-review"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;printer-review&#39;"" rel=""tag"">printer-review</a>, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/buyer-review"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;buyer-review&#39;"" rel=""tag"">buyer-review</a>, or <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printer-reference"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;printer-reference&#39;"" rel=""tag"">printer-reference</a>? The idea being that certain questions would inherit one of these tags (or something similar) to help facilitate traffic to specific questions. These questions would pose ideally be (in the OP's eyes) useful in making a purchase decision. </p>

<p>Case in point:
<a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/801/cons-to-uv-printing"">This question</a>, outlining some of the potential relative cons to UV printing compared to FDM/FFF printing, could prove useful to someone looking into purchasing a new UV printer.</p>

<p>This idea can be combined with those proposed <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/159/is-there-any-way-to-prevent-endless-best-first-printer-posts"">here</a>, such as @TomvanderZanden's suggestion to create a series of controlled ""best"" questions.</p>

<p><strong>Amendment</strong></p>

<p>I might also suggest that if we, as a community, decide to use such a system have moderators lock these questions to avoid any sort of spam (unnecessary answers). These questions should also be set to <strong><em>community wiki</em></strong> to ensure that any bias is dealt with as a community.</p>

<p>I know this post <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/30/vote-early-vote-often"">Vote early, Vote often</a>, and I do take it to be still the general guideline on how to vote on 3DP:SE.</p>

<p>I personally do like to vote what I'd call slightly more liberal than conservative and I do have the feeling that this is not the way it is usually handled by other users (as can probably be seen by the fact that only two people on 3DP:SE acquired the civic duty badge).</p>

<p>Also, if I look at the questions from the beginning time of the beta, there were much more votes in general. (This of course might be related to many things as 'more substantial questions and answers', more regular users and time that has passed since the question exists, allowing for more views and hence votes).</p>

<p>If a new question already has 40 views, however, I would expect more than 2 votes on the question. It means that 38 views happened in short time, this is, mainly views by 3DP:SE regulars, not search engine referrals (I strongly asumme this point, I do not have any hard evidence), which did look at the topic but have not been touched by the topic enough to vote up, down, or comment.</p>

<p>In general this probably is pretty regular behavior (seeing my behavior in the reprap forum for example, where I generally only pass to read, not to interact that much). In the phase this SE is in I'd take it as highly beneficial if we could encourage more action in the users (in this thread the most simple one - voting), because missing interaction maybe won't bring users back regularly enough.</p>

<p>However, I have an idea of something I'd like to have 3D printed. While the idea has a fairly reasonably defined shape in mind, it doesn't exist in any digital or paper format and has some specifics that still need to be filled out (such as accurate dimensions and a few design details).</p>

<p>I need to bridge the chasm of knowledge between my current design and limited knowledge to a fleshed-out design file with chosen materials and other specifics. A good chunk of my problem is that I don't even know <em>what</em> I should know. While I realize that this site is still fairly new and things are being nailed down, how do I ask the proper question(s) to fill in my knowledge gaps that will be on-topic for the site?

<p>I don't really know what the value here is over other forums other than the site being owned by a neutral party.  The forums at reprap.org would probably be the closest thing to this site seeing as how they have no real ties to any one printer/design/company and moderation is quite lax as in you can post nearly anything 3D printing related and not encounter any trouble.  The problem I believe is the site is trying to compete with other forums, one of which has been ""the"" forum pretty much since printing began and the main domain holds the majority of the information about home 3D printing.</p>

<h3>So what are these ""Community Ads?""</h3>

<p>Graduated sites allow the community to advertise relevant products or services within the site, using a system where the community chooses what to advertise. You can find these posts on per-site metas. Hint: these posts have the <a href=""/questions/tagged/community-ads"" class=""post-tag moderator-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;community-ads&#39;"" rel=""tag"">community-ads</a> tag!</p>

<h3>Cool! What should the ad be like?</h3>

<p>There's a few requirements for these ads. Most notably,</p>

<ul>
<li>They must be 300px wide by 250px tall, or double for ""retina"" displays</li>
<li>There's a limit on file size of 150 kB.</li>
<li>The image must be hosted on i.stack.imgur (the Stack Exchange image hosting service).</li>
<li>Ads must be GIF or PNG (no animated GIFs).</li>
</ul>

<h3>What else should I know?</h3>

<p>To facilitate easy posting to other sites, make sure that the embedded image is of the following format:</p>

<pre>[![Tagline to show on mouseover][1]][2]

   [1]: http://image-url
   [2]: http://clickthrough-url 
</pre>

<p>You can also include a message as a part of your answer with your own thoughts: why you chose some of the elements, and what sites the ads could potentially be posted to. Don't forget to critique each other as well!</p>

30,1,2016-01-13T06:06:45.117,19,207,"<p><strong>A big shout out to all of us for a successful graduation into private beta. 
Let's make it a success now, and make sure we graduate into a full-fledged site. 
So, this is one post which every user of a private beta site should read and act accordingly.</strong></p>

<p>This is a reproduction of a moderator's (Richard) <a href=""https://hermeneutics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/49"">post on meta.hermeneutics.SE</a>; I believe it is very much applicable to this community as well. Richard wrote a post encouraging voting. I think this is a big issue because rep is the basis of our ""economy"", encourages (good) user activity, sorts out our content and makes the site look active. In particular <strong>Question Votes</strong> make the site look more active.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I cannot state this strongly enough.  Voting is <em>absolutely critical</em> to the formation of a healthy SE site.  And this is never more true than in Private and early Public beta.  </p>
  
  <h3>Vote on Questions</h3>
  
  <p>Voting allows the community to determine what topics are allowed and what are not.  Voting shows what constitutes a well-formed question and what is unacceptable for this community.</p>
  
  <p>If you need help formulating better questions, the blog post <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/asking-better-questions/"">Asking Better Questions</a> might help you out.  (Admittedly, it's geared towards the Stackoverflow crowd, but the philosophies there will help).  Also, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/how-to-ask"">How to Ask</a> directly from StackOverflow is an excellent resource.</p>
  
  <p>Finally, I want to reiterate that <strong>Voting on questions  is free!</strong>  It doesn't cost you any reputation to to vote a question down.  (Compared to answers:)</p>
  
  <h3>Vote on Answers</h3>
  
  <p>Voting on answers allows a dramatic increase in reputation.  Like questions, it shows that you believe and support the answer provided.  Also, vote answers up that you think are well worded and support the answer given.  </p>
  
  <p><em>You don't have to agree with an answer to vote it up!</em></p>
  
  <p>To show that this is true, they've even created a <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/badges/63/sportsmanship"">badge for voting up competing answers (called ""Sportsmanship"")</a>.</p>
  
  <p>If you think an answer is <em>useful</em>, vote it up.  If you think an answer is <em>not useful</em>, vote it down.  Either way, <strong>vote</strong>!</p>
  
  <p>If you need help on writing answers, the meta post <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/7656/how-do-i-write-a-good-answer-to-a-question"">How do I write a good answer to a question?</a> will help you out.</p>
  
  <h3>Final thoughts</h3>
  
  <p>If people do not vote, there won't be enough reputation on this site for it to be promoted.  Reputation is very important to a StackExchange site as it creates the groups of people capable of maintaining the site.</p>
  
  <p>To show how critical it is, Jeff Atwood posted a blog article regarding this topic: <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/vote-early-vote-often/"">Vote Early, Vote Often</a></p>
  
  <h3>Encourage others to vote!</h3>
  
  <p>Quoting RobertCartaino from chat:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Vote, vote, vote. Encourage others to vote, vote, vote. On good content, leave signposts (""If you like this, please vote it up. It's important for the community!"")-- in both meta and the main site. Maybe a few meta posts informing the users of the important of that type of participation. You are empowered a lot more than you know.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't upvote bad content (edit/suggest how to fix it instead) but make sure you remember to vote, especially for questions; if you learned something from an answer on a question, the question's probably worth an upvote too so others can find the good information.</p>

The specific example I'm referring to is here: <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60"">https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/a/29/60</a></p>

<p>In many cases on SE, I see people post ""Answers"" that basically say ""Don't do what you're doing.  Instead you can get to your goal by doing this.""  While it is often helpful, this form of answer is the bane of my existence as a user of SE sites.</p>

<p>There are often cases when I am googling a difficult problem because I cannot do ""alternative a"" as suggested by the answerer.  Then, I get to an SE question that asked about exactly the situation I am having.  An answer of ""Don't do that, do this instead"" is upvoted, accepted, and the only answer.  Thus, I am unable to solve my problem using SE.  In other words, the Answer didn't apply to the question, and so SE led me down the wrong path.</p>

<p>Am I doing something wrong here?  Is this an expected/accepted pattern?  Or is this something I should go the route of downvoting?  Or like the poster of the above answer suggests, flagging?</p>

<p>However, the point is that it's very easy to involve 3D printing in a question that isn't about 3D printing. Drilling a hole in a 3D printed part is, for the most part, just like drilling one in wood. Such questions may be more suited for a general DIY/makers-type site.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there do exist 3D printing specific issues (for instance, low infill or delamination can be a problem when drilling in a (FDM) 3D printed part).</p>

<p>At what point does a question involving 3D printing become on-topic for our site? Should questions identify a specific issue (""I've tried drilling a hole, now my part has delaminated, what now?"")?. Queries for general advice and best practice don't seem to fit the bill of being difficult and specific.</p>

<h2>What’s the “elevator pitch” for our site?</h2>

<p>Imagine you’ve just gotten on an elevator with a friendly stranger. You have precisely one floor to describe your community to them. What would you say? The elevator pitch is a brief sentence that describes <em>what your site is about</em>. Every word counts!</p>

<p>Once decided, it can be sliced and diced to form:</p>

<ul>
<li>the tagline</li>
<li>the motto</li>
<li>the blurb under the logo</li>
<li>a convenience redirect “nickname” for the site</li>
<li>perhaps eventually the domain name <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/07/domain-names/"">in some form</a></li>
</ul>

<p>(Due to a variety of <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/10/domain-names-the-wrong-question/"">practical difficulties with domain names</a>, we prefer to de-emphasize domain name selection. Most sites will retain their <code>topic.stackexchange.com</code> names indefinitely.)</p>

<p>Naming is hard — <em>really</em> hard. But if you can come up with a sensible elevator pitch for your community, it’s a great starting point.</p>

  <li>Show an interest in their meta’s community-building activities.</li>
  <li>Lead by example, showing patience and respect for their fellow community members in everything they write.</li>
  <li>Exhibit those intangible traits discussed in <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a>.</li>

  <li>Members with participation in both meta and the parent site (i.e. interest in both community building and expertise in the field).</li>
  <li>Area 51 participation, social network referrals, or blogging about the site.</li>
  <li>Members who have already shown an interest or ability to promote their community.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Candidates will be contacted and three of them will be selected to act as provisional Moderators until the community holds formal elections after the Beta period. Besides the normal abilities of a Moderator, they will:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>Have access to a special chat room where we will collectively work through the challenges of moderation and community self-policing.</li>
  <li>Organize the process of selecting the site's attributes (domain names, design issues, the FAQ, etc.).</li>
  <li>Rally community support and drive the mission of getting publicity for the site.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Essentially, <strong>they will have the ear of the Stack Exchange team for anything we can do to help their sites succeed!</strong></p>

<p>Although the moderators pro tempore will ultimately be selected by Stack Exchange, the purpose of this post is to seek out and propose candidates:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each nomination should be posted as an answer and it should include (at minimum) a link to the user's main and meta profile so we can check out their activity.</li>
<li>Self nominations are encouraged, step up if you feel you can help.</li>
<li>If you are nominated by someone else you should edit the answer and let us know if you accept or decline (explanation optional). If a nominee declines we will not delete the answer, as to not have someone else nominate them again.</li>
<li>If you are nominating someone else, please mark the post as Community Wiki before saving. Meta doesn't allow suggested edits, so your nominee may be blocked from accepting the nomination.</li>
<li>The nominations are not binding to Stack Exchange or the nominees. If you are being considered by Stack Exchange, you will get an official confirmation email at one point. </li>
<li>Before nominating someone or accept / decline a nomination, you should read <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/05/a-theory-of-moderation/""><em>A Theory of Moderation</em></a> thoroughly to find out what's generally expected from moderators.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to learn more about the role, please drop into <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216/3d-printing"">chat room</a> where you can ask about the role from other moderators (they appear with a blue name in the chat room). Another chatroom called <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/2691/the-assembly"">The Assembly</a> was created specifically for users and moderators to discuss moderation activities, moderators from all over the network are there to answer your questions.</p>

<h2>What should our documentation contain?</h2>
<p>Much of the sites documentation will be the same as on every other Stack Exchange site: “be nice,” “how to create an account,” “how to ask questions” — it’s all pretty static. Even the sections about “what kind of questions should I (not) ask here?” comes primarily from <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq#questions"">the Definition phase of Area 51</a>.</p>
<p>But the questions you want to discuss in meta are those issues specific to your site that need to be mentioned in the Help Center.</p>
<p>Take the <a href=""https://superuser.com/faq"">Super User &quot;About&quot; page</a> as an example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Super User is for computer enthusiasts and power users.</p>
<p>Ask about...</p>
<ul>
<li>Specific issues with computer software, hardware or networking</li>
<li>Real problems or questions that you’ve encountered</li>
</ul>
<p>Don't ask about...</p>
<ul>
<li>Anything not directly related to computer software or computer hardware</li>
<li>Questions that are primarily opinion-based</li>
<li>Questions with too many possible answers or require an extremely long answer</li>
<li>Videogames, consoles, or other electronic devices, unless they connect to your computer</li>
<li>Websites or web services like Google, Facebook, Twitter, and WordPress</li>
<li>Shopping, buying or product recommendations</li>
<li>Issues specific to corporate IT support and networks</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>These are then elaborated on in SU's <a href=""https://superuser.com/help/on-topic"">What topics can I ask about here?</a> page.</p>
<p>It took almost a year to figure out the list of “we want these sort of questions” and “we don’t want these sort of questions” on Super User. Area 51 gave you a head start but you should also be working out other FAQ-related issues <strong>specific to your topic and your community</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>$SiteShortName</strong> is for 3d printer professionals, hobbyists, researchers and students.</p>

<p>We ask and answer questions about 3d printers, control systems, control theory, algorithms, actuators and sensors.</p>

<p>We feel the best <em>3d printer</em> questions have links to pertinent datasheets or code, but if your question generally covers …</p>

<ul>
<li>a specific 3d printer design or implementation problem</li>
<li>the theory and simulation of 3d printers</li>
<li>a sensor, actuator or controller for a 3d printer</li>
<li>algorithms or techniques for 3d printing</li>
</ul>

<p>… then you’re in the right place to ask your question!</p>

<p>Some kinds of questions aren't allowed here:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Shopping recommendations</strong>: Questions which ask ""which product or library should I use"" or ""Where can I buy X"", are considered <a href=""http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/11/qa-is-hard-lets-go-shopping/"">shopping recommendations</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Electronics theory</strong>: Questions which are more general electrical engineering questions and have no real relation to 3d printers are better off at <a href=""http://electronics.stackexchange.com"">Electrical Engineering</a>.</li>

<li><strong>Programming</strong>: Generic programming questions with no relation to 3d printers should be asked on <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com"">Stack Overflow</a>.</li>

<li><strong>CAD/CAM</strong>: Questions about computer aided design and manufacture should be be asked on <a href=""http://engineering.stackexchange.com"">Engineering</a>, unless they are related to 3d printing, in which they are fine here.</li>

<li><strong>Life Questions</strong>: Questions about choosing how to spend your time (what book to read, which class to take, what 3d printer project to construct, what career to pursue, etc.) may be about difficult decisions, and they are often important, but they are too specific to your own situation and are unlikely to help future visitors to the site. They would be better off asked in <a href=""http://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/34216"">3d Printing Chat</a>.</li>

</ul>

<p>Generally speaking, if your question is directly related to <em>3d printers</em> then even if your question might <em>also</em> be appropriate on another site, we are likely to be happy to see it here.</p>

<p>Please <a href=""/search"">look around</a> to see if your question has been asked before. It’s also OK to <a href=""/helpcenter/self-answer"">ask and answer your own question</a>.</p>

<p>If your question is not specifically on-topic for $SiteName, it may be on topic for <a href=""http://stackexchange.com/sites"">another Stack Exchange site</a>. If no site currently exists that will accept your question, you may <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/faq"">commit to</a> or <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76974/how-can-i-propose-a-new-site"">propose</a> a new site at <a href=""http://area51.stackexchange.com/"">Area51</a>, the place where new Stack Exchange communities are democratically created.</p>

73,2,2016-01-23T04:28:11.173,1,,"<p>The problem with the questions you raised are (except for the camera one) that they are all about dealing with the materials that are used with 3D-printing and not about the mechanics of printing. But when I started 3D-printing, that's certainly where a large part of my questions lay. It's because the materials are DIFFERENT than ones we're used to dealing with, and if it weren't for 3D-printing, I wouldn't have been working with them then. It's BECAUSE I was 3D-printing that the questions arose. There are certainly similarities between the materials used for 3D-printing and other materials we might run into, but there are also vast differences. For example, ABS is the same plastic that we know from Legos. But how does working with the plastic that's been 3D-printed differ from working with a Lego? I would consider any question about that area to be valid. You mention drilling plastic, but then got the answer wrong. It is NOT like drilling wood; the way you drill plastic should be different from how you deal with wood, such as the speeds used and the use of hand drills. There are even special plastic bits that you can buy that make it easier to drill plastic. Good questions might be: for PLA, ABS and other 3dpg plastics, when is it appropriate to use such bits and when can you get away with using high speed drill bits like you would use for wood? Are higher drill speeds better than lower speeds for some 3D-printed plastics and not others, or vice versa?</p>

<p>In summary, I feel that questions about a technique or material that is being used in the 3D-printing process, or dealing with the materials afterward, should be valid because 3D-printing changes how the techniques are done or the materials are dealt with.</p>

It's far better to ask a specific question such as <em>""How do I smooth this ABS print to eliminate all signs that it was 3D printed?""</em> and receive several good answers, than to have a one-stop-wiki question that attempts (and usually does very poorly) at holding all the answers to all the possible smoothing questions.</p>

<p>I've had my eyes in 3D printing since about 2008 when I first heard of the MakerBot Cupkake CNC and delved into the 3D printing realm in 2011 when I bought my first printer (Replicator Dual). I've learned a great deal through trial and error and am excited to help others who may be just starting in 3D printing.</p>

<p>As this site continues to attract more members, I've enjoyed seeing new posts and trying to help direct proper questions/answers based on the general consensus I've seen here on Meta. Although I'm not extremely involved in Meta, I do try to keep up on what's being said.</p>

<p>I have been an active user of several Stack Exchange sites since 2012, but have finally now found a site that I really can contribute to. </p>

<p>As a robotics engineer by education, I early got interested in the art of 3D printing, and decided to join the community for myself in 2014 when I graduated from university. Over the past two years I have experimented with my trustworthy Kossel Mini printer to the point where I now need to set new challenges to still have something to do. Taking part in the Stack Exchange 3D Printer community has provided me further challenges and learning potential, which I truly appreciate.</p>

<p>I already spend a lot of time on this site, and try to help new users uphold the quality standard found on SE sites, answer questions and finish the review queues whenever possible. Overall, I am very proud of how this site has turned out so far, and would very much like to help it progress further. </p>

<p>To me, taking on further tasks of moderation seems like a natural step, and I hope you will allow me the opportunity to contribute as a moderator in the future.</p>

I think if you titled your question along the lines of ""How small can I expect the daVinci 1.0 AiO to print?"" and elaborating on your specific needs in the bulk of the question could directly answer your question while upholding the values of the community and may possibly lead to suggestions to other machines/processes.</p>

<p>On a site such as SO, these are the kind of questions that ends up ""staying"", getting a high view counts and the great answers. There are, however, also a large amount of <em>new</em> questions on SO that never meet those standards, but rather face the same kind of problems that we see here.</p>

<p>I believe the issue for most new users - here and on SO - is that <em>in order to ask a good question, you more or less already need to know the answer</em>, or at least the format of the answer. And with 3D printing being such a novel technology for most users, they simply do not have the required experience to ask the ""correct"" question at their first attempt.</p>

<p>Perhaps our job should lean more towards <em>helping users to find out what they really should be asking about</em>, rather than simply voting down or closing the question right away because it does not uphold our desired standard. As for how to accomplish that, I think the points mentioned by @tbm0115 could be a good starting point.</p>

<p>On Robotics, one of my <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/177/37"">Copy-pastable comment text for common problems with questions?</a> is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <h3>Questions by new users for closed for other reasons</h3>
  
  <p><code>Welcome to *robotics* XXX, but I'm afraid that questions like this really aren't a good fit for a stack exchange site. We prefer *[practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face](http://robotics.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask)*.

If you edit your question to fit our community guidelines we can reopen it for you.</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Closure is intended to <strong>temporarily</strong> stop people answering questions which can't be easily answered in their present form, <strong>while the question is being improved</strong>. As such, I disagree with <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/112/63"">tbm0115's suggestion</a> that we should artificially delay closing a question (at this stage in the sites life there aren't enough people closing questions as it is) and suggest that we always close a poor question as soon as possible, but give people the information they need to fix the problem.</p>

<p>Instead, I offer the following suggestion:</p>

<ul>
<li>If you want to vote to close a question without writing a comment to say why, with suggestions as to how to fix the problem, think about how this looks to a new user and how they might feel about the <em>rejection</em>.</li>
</ul>

<p>If people assume there is nothing they can do about their question being closed, and this drives them away, then we should do all we can to correct that misunderstanding, encourage them to learn how Stack Exchange works and ask better questions.</p>

<p>Finally, don't forget the importance of <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">broken windows theory</a>.</p>

<p>The quicker poor questions are closed, the higher the good:bad question ratio is, the more likely new users will see examples of good questions, and the less likely that they will base their own question on a poor example of a question. This is why good questions are the most important thing on a new site. They draw in experts to answer them and they set a good example for how new questions should be framed.</p>

<p>So, close early, close often, and comment with the information needed to get the question re-opened.</p>

119,2,2016-03-29T18:45:45.210,1,,"<p>Firstly, the appeal to being a user on a StackExchange site is the general Q&amp;A structure which differentiates itself from common forum-based websites. I personally find the structure of the StackExchange sites easy to navigate and appreciate the amount of moderation that goes into each site.</p>
<h1>Search Engines</h1>
<p>Most traffic will most likely come from search engines (ie Google, Yahoo, etc.) which can find the questions/answers easiest from the use of Tags here on StackExchange.</p>
<p>So, the first thing to keep in mind is ensuring the tags you use are plenty and accurate with each question you ask. This will help increase the chances of a search engine showing your question higher in its results list.</p>
<p>Another factor, with regard to search engines, is the title of the question. Generally people are going to be more attracted to a specific question as they feel it will answer their question better. For example:</p>
<p><em><strong>Extruder keeps jamming</strong></em> as a question title will probably not attract users to view the question as it is very vague.</p>
<p><em><strong>MakerBot Replicator extruder jams with new filament</strong></em> as a question title is more specific and contains more &quot;keywords&quot; that a search engine can find. Obviously, this can also potentially deter certain users (say Ultimaker users), but the hope is that the tag system will help offset this issue.</p>
<h1>Etiquette</h1>
<p>I agree with you in that I also find it difficult to &quot;advertise&quot; the 3D printing community on other websites. As it may be considered improper etiquette here on the StackExchange network to advertise or promote other websites, I wouldn't recommend &quot;advertising&quot; the community as a whole. However, if you notice, many answers on the StackExchange network include links to other forum or Q&amp;A sites (ie MSDN, CodeProject, etc.). With this in mind, I personally feel that it is appropriate to post links to specific questions here on the 3D Printing community on another site if it can benefit the users on the other site.</p>
<p>If you are wanting to personally focus on bringing more traffic, you could participate on some of the forums you mentioned and try providing relevant links to this community. But, in the interest of maintaining quality on both websites, please remain respectful and courteous.</p>

<li>Are their cases when the tag should not be used?</li>
<li>Likewise, are their cases when the tag should be used?</li>
<li>Is the existing excerpt empty? Something is usually better than nothing.</li>

<p>That's like saying, <em>[abs]: For questions about [abs] filaments.</em> That should probably be rejected.</p>

<p>Or even better: <em>[abs]: For questions about [abs] filaments - filaments that are used with blah blah printers, and are not toxic for use. Not to be confused with [pla] filaments. Do not use this tag if your question does not concern this filament specifically.</em></p>

So, questions that may be considered <em>too broad</em> as a general materials question may be a viable question for a newbie to the 3D printing world.

While it may be technically <em>too broad</em> asking materials questions, in reality, most questions (in FDM/FFF realm) are going to be either about PLA or ABS (maybe Nylon) unless there is a specified purpose for the object.

If you later discover that a particular subject poses a problem, <strong><em>then</em></strong> the community can decide if you should forgo those questions entirely.

<p>Our role in making the Internet a better place is in curating a high-quality collection of crowd-sourced knowledge. Stack Exchange rates very highly among search engines, so when someone clicks through thinking they finally found an answer from a highly-trusted source, <strong>we have a responsibility <em>not</em> to purport having information we do not.</strong> </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>sometimes it's better to accept not-perfect-answer than leave the man with no answer at all</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That's a well-meaning consideration, but it ignores the purpose of curating this content as a whole. You may help that <em>one</em> person in the minimal possible sense&hellip; but for the hundreds (sometimes <em>thousands</em>) of people who come after, all we did was create yet <strong>another barrier</strong> between the user and the information they were searching for.</p>

<p>That does not make the Internet better.</p>

<p>Redirecting users elsewhere can also displace folks who may have posted a <em>proper</em> answer. Few people are actually privy to these meta discussions and what makes these Stack Exchange sites ""work"", so oftentimes users looking on will largely consider the issue <em>resolved.</em> Folks mostly emulate the practices and methods they see, so if cutting and pasting a link serves as an answer, then <em>everyone</em> can do it. </p>

<p>And in that vein, please do not answer questions in comments. Comments do not have the voting and the wiki-style editing features which allow us to properly vet and improve this content. And comments sit very prominently right there below the question, so they appear before even the <em>best</em> answers which are supposed to rise to the top. </p>

<h1>1.</h1>
<p>Often, what we do is you have a canonical &quot;catch-all&quot; question.</p>
<p>Since the shopping questions seem to have been deemed off-topic, this is probably your best bet. What you need to do is to guide users to select a printer themselves, but by asking them a set of criteria. Therefore, you would need an answer that addresses the following questions (but in no way limited to the following):</p>
<ul>
<li>What filament do I choose?</li>
<li>What's my budget?</li>
<li>What size do I need?</li>
</ul>
<p>... etc.</p>
<p>With such a post, you guide users to what they want, and then in the end, you can recommend a few printers.</p>
<p>Also, this question has to be locked using what's known as a wiki-lock. This way, the community can edit the question to update it, and it prevents spam and other nonsensical answers.</p>
<h1>2.</h1>
<p>You close them as off-topic.</p>
<p>Since this seems to be a persistent problem, it would be helpful to add a custom close reason (hey mods! That's for you!). Something along the lines of this would be good:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Questions asking for the recommendation of a printer or other 3D printing-related resource are off-topic because they tend to attract opinion-based questions, low-quality answers, and spam. For more information, see [Why are recommendations off-topic and where can I ask?](link to a meta post)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You get the community to get support for the close reason, and a moderator implements it to allow questions to be closed. Bingo!</p>
<p>However, you're going to need a meta post explaining why they are off-topic as well as other information. That's good etiquette: you don't leave users stranded and you continue to guide them to where they can ask a question.</p>
<h1>3.</h1>
<p>You do 1. first.</p>
<p>Then, you allow such &quot;shopping&quot; questions to be on-topic, as long as they follow the specific criteria and answer all the questions that you have outlined in the meta post. Otherwise, you close it.</p>
<p>Numerous sites do this. On Open Source, we allow questions that ask for the recommendation of an open source license. We have a meta post on what you need to include, as well as a dedicated close reason in case something is not of quality. It works very well.</p>

Typically you want to stay away from asking questions about <em>""What is the best...""</em>. Instead, try to present your question as more of a <em>""What is the best... for me?""</em> type question. As I mentioned in your other question, try to provide more details of what you might need. In the case of 3D printing services, I'll use the example of 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ <sub>(I'm not affiliated at all, just an example)</sub>.</p>

<p>A <em>""What is best...""</em> question may be appropriate if the contents of your question contains key characteristics of what you, as an individual, needs out of the service. For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I need a part printed, but I also need this key feature machined and coated. I've looked at 3D Hubs and MakeXYZ, which (at this point) would be able to perform all of these operations for my part?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On the opposite perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to start providing 3D printing services, but I have a CNC router and some other woodworking machines that I'd like to provide services for as well. Which might be better for me, 3D Hubs or MakeXYZ?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In each example, there is more of an emphasis on what you need as an individual. Another user can take the answers with a grain of salt and best apply the answers to their own situation in the end. </p>

<li>Support structures helps define relevance to the existence of support structure being generated and/or their physical dimensions.</li>

<p>However, if the question of ""<em>How can I change the thermistors settings in Marlin firmware?</em>"" were to arise, then the question would be best suited here on 3D Printing. It might help both SE sites by providing links to each other's relevant questions for future users to reference.</p>

<p>If the question was something like ""<em>How can I wire a hotend?</em>"", this would be more appropriate here on 3D Printing SE as users in Electrical Engineering SE may not know as much about the topic compared to users in 3D Printing.

184,2,2016-08-13T23:19:45.423,4,,"<p>There are tens of SE sites that deal with programming in some way, shape or form. SO is obviously the most general one of these, but there are many more specialized ones (CodeReview,TeX,Programmers,Drupal/Wordpress/Joomla/Server Fault/Ubuntu/...). If this site had been ""Makers StackExchange"" or ""Digital Fabrication"" then your question might have been appropriate (this site being a more general one), but ""3D printing"" should be seen as a more specialized one (but if you think there is a need for a specific Makers SE or a CNC SE, then you could consider going to Area51).</p>

<p>This site is called ""3D printing"" and CNC milling is definitely not 3D printing. I think it does very much make sense to limit 3D printing to ""additive fabrication"". This is not a particularly narrow scope, since there are many types of 3D printer, and not all of them use G-code. Powder printers (binder jetting) and DLP printers are driven with raster images, for instance.</p>

<li><strong>Informational objective:</strong> ""Get a resin based printer because they typically have better resolution than FDM printers (...)""</li>
</ol>

<p>While the first is almost entirely opinion based, the second can offer some proper insight that will help the OP in search for a specific printer. In these cases, I suggest that we try to guide the OP into formulating their question such that they promote answers of the the second type, rather than the first.</p>

However, this must be my (inaccurate) perception, as the stats shows that the voting is not at the desired levels.</p>

<p>While it is important to votes and vote often, it is worth remembering that we shouldn't just vote willy-nilly. I have noticed that some beta sites, especially in the early days, tend to get rather frenzied (or, if you will, overly enthusiastic) voting, which one does not necessarily see in the more established sites, where the voting has settled down and only the (oft mentioned) <em>awesome</em> answers are voted for. This overly enthusiastic voting can <em>sometimes</em> end up giving random votes to questions that are not particularly researched, or answers that are not fully accurate, which maybe do not deserve any votes at all.</p>

<p>I am not sure why this (comparatively) frenzied voting occurs, or why it dies down, nor am I sure what (which?) level of voting is appropriate - although it is obvious that poorly researched questions and inaccurate answers should not be voted up. </p>

<li>3D printers are really pretty simple compared to the other topics I mentioned above.  There aren't going to be as many questions.</li>

<p>3D Printing is part of the general Maker Culture and Makers want to not just ask; but, they want to show off and talk about what they make.  That is a lot of what I see on the other venues and that may be why we aren't getting as much traction here.</p>

<li>It gives us a way to point people on forums here.  I often see links to reviews on forums.  Why can't those point here?  Once they are here, hopefully we will stay and contribute.</li>

<h3>Concerns</h3>

<p>So, yes, I think it would be worth starting one up and seeing how it goes... although I would be a little concerned about the regularity of posts: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Plan a schedule</strong>. Given the results of steps #2 and #3, think about a rough idea of a schedule for the blog. Will there be one post a week, posted Mondays? Will there be posts on Tuesdays and posts on Fridays? You don’t need to be pushing out posts daily, but you should post at least once a week.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>and</em></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Pick a posting schedule and stick to it</strong>. It is easier to simply keep up from the get go than catch up if you fall behind.  Have a couple draft posts stashed away for a rainy day, ready to go that can be published if there is a lull.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, who would coordinate it? Are you putting yourself forward?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Have someone holding the reins</strong>. This person doesn’t need to be the one writing all the posts, just someone that helps coordinate who is writing what and when it is getting posted.</p>

<p>However, it <em>is</em> a bit of a misfortune that Blog Overflow has a rather unfortunately acronym (as well as sounding like <em>Bog</em> Overflow).</p>

Essentially any similarly named tags from this site could be provided almost as an Ad on, say, Arduino.SE if someone searches that site for a question or answer related to that tag.</p>

<p>For instance, if someone is searching for information on special pinouts available on the ""MightyBoard"" controller (which is similar to Arduino), then questions available on our site related to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/mightyboard"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;mightyboard&#39;"" rel=""tag"">mightyboard</a> can show up amidst the regular search results.</p>

<p>This would negate the need for moderators or community members needing to individually refer posts to other sites and provide new sites the opportunity to bring more members in.</p>

254,2,2018-02-04T19:44:56.617,2,,"<p>A good question. I'm currently using insights I obtained from mucking about with a 3D printer with Arduino Mega 2560 and RAMPS 1.4 to dive into retrofitting an elderly CNC router (but, as a router, still, not as a printer) with a new control system (presently thinking and have on order Arduino Uno R3 and Arduino CNC shield R3, we'll see how implementation goes on those) and was wondering if I could ask questions here that would overlap, or not, as I don't think there's a CNC/subtractive community similar to this 3DP/additive one in the ecosystem yet.</p>

<p>I actually started out thinking I could just use the same controller setup (there's plenty of stepper driver slots available, and going ""dual-purpose"" cut and print is potentially interesting) but it seems the official GRBL fork is not 2560 compatible, though there is a fork to try and make it so - it seemed more of a sure bet to stick with the ""official"" fork and the common hardware.</p>

<p>Likewise I've seen a bit of chatter about making Marlin switch-hit CNC/3DP, but I get the impression it's not all there yet, and I'm more interested in immediately usable based on current/past efforts than trying to develop new functionality my dang self.</p>

263,2,2018-05-24T16:21:25.110,4,,"<p>One thing that I have noticed, especially after having been away for nearly a year, is how the mood of the site has changed, ever so slightly. It is just that recently there seem to be a bit more of the ""Did you google first, before asking here"" type comments (accompanied by a vote to close), in particular to newbie questions, or at least questions from those new to SE, but maybe not so new at 3D printing. I don't remember these types of comments so much prior to a year or so ago.</p>

<p>While I agree that people need to do research, or at least demonstrate that they have done a bit, if people are coming here and asking an honest question (which is not a lazy homework related - and let's face it, there are not many, if any, 3D printer related homework questions) and that question is from someone genuinely interested in 3D printer with a tangible problem, then try to answer it, or at least provide a helpful comment.</p>

<p>Seeing as we are not-quite-desperate-for-users but have an issue with user retention, then we should really not be  throwing google in their face - no matter how frustrating a question may seem, or how obvious the answer appears to an old hand. Do we really want them running off to Reddit, or Quora, or Ask (Jeeves) or (god forbid) Yahoo answers, or some other place? Or is it better that we get them to stay here?</p>

<p>Believe me when I say that I know how irritating it can get, I have been there myself. I ended up not spending much time on SE.Arduino, for that same reason - in the end most of the questions started to seem nonsensical, repetitive and idiotic... because I had seen the same topics asked over and over again. I realised that I had to take a deep breath and step back a little - just because I knew the answer and had helped too many people before with the same issue, it didn't mean that someone new would not come along tomorrow and ask the same thing. </p>

<p>Yes, they should have checked google first, and yes, they should have seen the duplicate question had already been asked. However, maybe they didn't have the luxury of time to spend hours googling, or maybe they had not used the right search terms, or maybe English isn't their mother tongue, or whatever. However, it didn't mean that they needed to be made to feel daft. </p>

<p>After all, if someone asks a question here, it probably isn't because they want to wind us up and make us angry - why would they do that? And it can't be judged as lazy, because, let's face it, it takes longer to formulate and ask a question on SE than it does to search for something on Google.</p>

<p>A couple of friends of mine, independently of eachother, sent me this image which, while it made me laugh, also (rather sadly) sums up the ""Why are you asking me that?"" mentality that StackExchange is perceived as having by the wider techy internet community - this is <em>not</em> a good reputation to have..!</p>

<p>So, all I am trying to say is, when you see a question asked by someone with a rep of 1, be nice and try to encourage them to stay, rather than scaring them off as soon as they set foot through the door. Don't forget it is probably their first question here and are quite nervous as to how they will be perceived (as one generally is when approaching a new group of people and having to ask something).</p>

<h3>Additional points of note</h3>
<p>The stats above aren't really the be all to end all... there are a few other considerations that I came across here, <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community/1355#1355"">in this answer</a>, to <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/1354/graduation-of-this-community"">“Graduation” of this Community</a>:</p>

<li>A number of 3k+ users ( <em>n</em> &gt; 10 ) are required to be able to fully vote</li>
</ol>
<h3>The final hurdle</h3>
<p>The main sticking point, according to this meta post on Ethereum, <a href=""https://ethereum.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/474/congratulations-ethereum-is-graduating"">Congratulations! Ethereum is graduating!</a>, is 10 questions per day, which we are a long way from, and seems to be the last remaining issue. A link (<a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/257614/graduation-site-closure-and-a-clearer-outlook-on-the-health-of-se-sites"">Graduation, site closure, and a clearer outlook on the health of SE sites</a>) from the Ethereum meta post to Meta.SE states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>When a site starts to consistently receive 10 questions/day, we’ll consider it for graduation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>No graduation, but losing the Beta label...</h3>
<p>Apart from graduation, SE management has recognised that small sites (with an active community) struggle to reach the 10 questions/day consistently. For sites that have been waiting to get out of Beta by graduation for 7-8 years, SE has decided to drop the Beta label. Please see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/331708/congratulations-to-our-29-oldest-beta-sites-theyre-now-no-longer-beta?cb=1"">Congratulations to our 29 oldest beta sites - They're now no longer beta!</a>.</p>

<hr />
<p>In digital video, photography, television and film, post-production refers to the tasks that must be completed or executed after the filming or shooting ends. This includes tasks such as the editing of raw footage to cut scenes, insert transition effects, working with voice and sound actors, and dubbing, to name a few of the many pre-production tasks. Post-production is the third and final step in film creation. It follows the pre-production and production phases.</p>

<p>According to the <em>magic Moderator portal</em>, we should be around 2,350 in visits per day. Also, my post was a little over a year and half ago.</p>
<p>To elaborate on my original post that @Greenonline attributed and reiterate the points:</p>
<h1>Accept Answers</h1>
<p>I have mentioned the <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/174/accepting-unanswered-questions"">accepted answers issue</a> before as well in a separate post, but there are currently <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/search?q=hasaccepted%3Ano%20answers%3A1"">571 unaccepted-answer questions WITH at least 1 answer available</a> out of 1,467 as of 06/06/2018 11:12pm UTC-7 (Pacific). That's almost <strong>40%</strong> of our content ripe for reputation. That equates to <strong>8,565 reputation</strong> points just by purely accepting one of the available answers.</p>
<p>I've periodically used the link above to retroactively remind users that they can approve of an answer. There's nothing wrong with reminding users in the comments, so long as it is asked appropriately. If you don't know how to word it, feel free to steal my wording from the post above.</p>
<h1>Vote</h1>
<p>I'm not the best at remembering to vote, but I typically vote both on the answer(s) that helped me AND the question(s). I think questions easily get overlooked in the voting process, but it does help our newer visitors.</p>

275,2,2018-06-10T20:55:52.410,1,,"<p>I think the way to go would be to migrate the answer (and its comments) to comments of the question.</p>

<p>As for Toonis' answer in the comment. I don't think that there is a way to create an answer for someone else. Functionality like that could be abused to achieve higher reputation. It's up to Toonis to create his/her own answer.</p>

<p>However, it is seen site-wide where users will create an answer attributing to the comment of another user. I think it is unspoken law that you remove your answer if the user ever creates their own answer. Ultimately, there are some users that just don't care about the reputation, so they would prefer to use the comments instead.</p>

<p>So, don't be afraid to create your own answer off of someone else's comments. Having explicit answers in the system will only make our site stronger.</p>

283,2,2018-06-25T14:45:37.390,4,,"<p>I was thinking about your question this morning, and I saw that there were no replies. SE 3D Printing is quite a small site and there aren't an awful lot of regulars here - but there are just enough who can give great answers, but not everyone ventures here, into meta.</p>
<p>I think that you <em>should</em> ask the question, it does seem on-topic. If it is well presented (without typos) and has the necessary detail, then it should be OK.  It is usually only very poorly worded, poorly formatted and overly broad questions, where little thought and research has been done beforehand, which are shot down in flames... :-)</p>
<p>Looking at your Reddit post, it seems ok, but it could be worth relevant quoting parts from those links that you listed (as links die over time and the information that you refer to could be lost), and show why or why not, <em>you</em> think certain options may or may not be suitable. Your question could also appear to be opinion-based or broad - so it could be better to narrow down your question to a point or two (or three).</p>
<p>If it <strong>does</strong> end up getting closed, which hopefully it won't as you do appear to have put some thought into it, you will be provided with guidance as to how to edit and improve it and make it more suitable for StackExchange.</p>
<p>I wouldn't worry too much, even the best of us have <em>bad post days</em> sometimes... it's not a big deal :-)</p>
<p>Also, think about it this way, the time that you take formulating and crafting your question will be well spent as it should help clarify your question in your own mind. Often, I have found, whilst writing and clarifying a question, that I had actually mis-understood the whole issue in the first place, and sometimes re-working a post can help me find my own solution (especially when using peoples comments to adjust the original post), or at the very least, help me get my head around the issue.</p>

285,2,2018-07-05T22:06:02.917,6,,"<p>Your ""vote"" is one of the key things. As Jon Ericson pointed out to Mechanics.SE before we graduated and were asking the same question asked here, he stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href=""https://mechanics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1447/4152""><em>... voting is the engine that drives the reputation economy</em></a>. </p>
</blockquote>

<p>I think Mech had a little different scenario than does 3D Printing, but it still holds true. If you want people to show up and do things, you (and everyone else) needs to vote. Up, down, sideways ... doesn't matter. They all help drive people to <em>do things</em> in every Stack.</p>

<p>Looking at the above link, you can see one of the things which is important to graduation is having the right user base. You have to have people who have the ability to do things which only those who have met the point level can do. As it stands the highest ranked person by point total is <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/users/26/tom-van-der-zanden"">Tom van der Zanden</a>. He hasn't (as of this writing) broached 10k points. There are two users who have more than 5k points, and another five who are over 2500. How do you improve this scenario? You guessed it, by voting. </p>

<p>I realize with sub two questions per day (QPD), there's not a lot to vote on. That can be overcome as well. Those of you who have had issues or have met challenges have knowledge. Write down those challenges you've faced in a question. Then, either write an answer for them, or let someone else figure them out. Either way, you are creating opportunity for the site to expand. That opportunity will be giving someone a chance to vote and/or answer the question. Plus, you are doing what SE wants done in the first place: <em>bringing and recording knowledge</em>. It's a win-win.</p>

<p>There's a ton of other things which can be done to get 3D Printing graduated. I'm sure we'll get there sooner or later. I hope I can help in some small way. I'm not the bastion of all knowledge to get a site graduated, that's for sure, but having gone through it with Mechanics gives me some insight.</p>

<p>Here's to the future and what it will bring.</p>

In the cases where you are right (such as the example that you cite), then the question would just need retagging correctly, but not require linking all of a particular printer's make/model related questions (via the <em>synonym-ising</em> (?) of the tag) back to that particular printer's type.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? Have I understood correctly?</p>

<p>As an example, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns <em>all</em> cartesian printers, but especially Prusa, you would have to manually tag that question <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aneta2"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aneta2&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aneta2</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prusa"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;prusa&#39;"" rel=""tag"">prusa</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cartesian"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cartesian&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cartesian</a>, so that it gets grouped in such a way, where Cartesian, Prusa and AnetA2 are subsets of the previous (super)set. I don't think you can internally link the tags, if you see what I mean, that mechanism doesn't exist.  </p>

<p>Likewise, if you have a generic question about a ANet A2 printer, that actually concerns <em>all</em> prusa printers (but <em>not necessarily</em> all cartesian printers), you would have to manually tag that question <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/aneta2"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;aneta2&#39;"" rel=""tag"">aneta2</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/prusa"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;prusa&#39;"" rel=""tag"">prusa</a> and <em>maybe</em> <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cartesian"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;cartesian&#39;"" rel=""tag"">cartesian</a>.</p>

294,2,2018-07-10T19:21:52.333,1,,"<p>It got too long to fit in a comment:</p>

<p>That does seem sort of reasonable. A DIY printer should be one that has been sourced from various parts. Or should that also include (or be exclusively) DIY designs? I mean, DIY means Do It Yourself, so a commercial kit, is literally a DIY printer, even though it is following a recognised design. It may seem a pedantic point over semantics but what is classed as DIY? Is it:</p>

<ol>
<li>A true home brew, DIY design? And everything made from scratch with a lathe and possibly another 3D printer?</li>
<li>Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github and printing the plastic parts yourself</li>
<li>Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but buying the plastic parts (because you don't yet have a printer)</li>
<li>Following a RepRap design straight of the Wiki/Github but a complete kit</li>
<li>Buying a commercial printer available as a kit, in kit form.</li>
</ol>

<p>To me, there is not much difference between the last two, <em>if</em> the commercial printer is derived from a RepRap. Even 2 and 3 are just as DIY as each other, really.</p>

<p>So, just to play devil's advocate, here are four real word scenarios... </p>

<ul>
<li>Would you class a P3Steel as a DIY <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/diy-3d-printer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;diy-3d-printer&#39;"" rel=""tag"">diy-3d-printer</a> tag <em>or</em> as a printer-kit <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/printer-building"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;printer-building&#39;"" rel=""tag"">printer-building</a> tag <em>if</em> the frame was purchased as a kit from Poland, but the rest of it was sourced separately from various places, such as Chinese eBay vendors? </li>
<li>Likewise, a Kossel, whose plastic parts were bought from a eBay vendor and then the aluminium struts were cut to length in the back streets of Bangkok - would that be a commercial kit (because the plastic parts were available commercially), or DIY? </li>
<li>Also, a Wilson II, whose plastic parts were from MJRice (the designer of the Wilson), but the aluminium came from a cottage industry aluminium extruder in Vietnam, who you had had to walk miles to find. Commercial kit or DIY tag?</li>
<li>Now, twisting it slightly... What about a complete Wilson II kit? Where the entire frame and kit has been purchased from an eBay vendor, or MJRice. Is that commercial or not? </li>
</ul>

<p>There seems to be a fine line between the last two. We might need to be very specific in the tag definitions if people aren't going to get confused.</p>

<p>If, all four examples are DIY then fine. If none of them are, because the plastic parts were purchased, then ok, we have a <em>very strict</em> definition of DIY.</p>

<p>Just for completeness, the first three scenarios are my personal purchasing experiences, where I considered them as DIY printers.</p>

<p>Now, to be fair to your question, I <em>think</em> I know what you mean. You are referring to printer kits from established manufacturers that are available pre-built, <em>or</em> as kits. Is that right? I just want to clarify what defines a commercial kit and a DIY kit.</p>

<p>Does that make sense? I might have got a bit carried away.</p>

295,2,2018-07-11T08:53:42.723,2,,"<p>A couple of points:</p>

<p>Asking for a machine to solve a specific problem, or software which can do something 'specific' is not really a shopping question, so long as the question is asked in the right way. We do need to avoid subjective questions, but sometimes this can be the result of a misunderstanding (i.e. find me a non-CN supplier of this budget Chinese printer {which also seems to be a decent product}).</p>

<p>Topics which bridge into something like Electronics can be useful because the field is very large, and EE.SE makes an assumption of near degree level expertise. Useful answers here could be more 'off the shelf' routes to achieving what could potentially be fairly 'textbook' to someone with the right background.</p>

<p>Same with making trivial changes to firmware, using a complex software tool for a trivial task, etc. If the task is common, relevant and bounded then a 'hand-holding' answer here will be much more valuable/findable than pushing questioners to a more specific site. Once people move from trivial use of these tools they may well end up needing to self-educate before they reach a point that EE.SE, or SO will accept their questions.</p>

<p>We're at a difficult point between a mass market consumer product, and emerging tech. The IoT site has similar challenges.</p>

<p>Here, the answer (assuming the question is actually the question that the user needed to ask) would be 'buy the cheapest meter you can find', or 'buy both, you might not make much use of a cheap meter anyway'. Context makes a big difference.</p>

300,2,2018-07-17T21:56:10.620,2,,"<p>To me, the dividing line between ""DIY"" and ""not DIY"" is who you deal with if a part is defective when you get it.</p>

<p>If you're contacting different vendors for a jammed bearing, a miswired stepper motor, or a dead controller board, it's DIY.  If you talk to the same person regardless of which part is defective out of the box, it's not DIY.  So, from Greenonline's examples, 1, 2, and 3 are DIY, while 4 and 5 aren't.</p>

<p>Yes, that means that a printer can evolve from ""not DIY"" to ""DIY"".  For example, if you start with a preassembled Prusa i3 Mk3, but then replace the V6 hotend with a Volcano hotend in an extruder found on Thingiverse, switch to a 320-watt Meanwell PSU, replace the display with a touchscreen, change out the ball bearings for sleeve bearings, upgrade the steppers for more precision, and install a BuildTak bed, you've now got a DIY printer.</p>

302,2,2018-07-18T23:27:26.807,1,,"<h3>Rationale: why do we close questions?</h3>

<p>There are really two ways to do moderation. If you've been on any of the <code>.moderated</code> newsgroups you'll be well aware that to get a post on there, it needs to undergo a review process first and be accepted. The aim is to keep problem discussions from arising.</p>

<p>SE is slightly different - it works the other  way. <em>Anyone</em> can ask a question on SE and closing a question is the equivalent of putting that question <em>back into review/improve mode</em>. It's a feedback mechanism designed to react to problem cases only, so the usual business of asking and answering good questions can just... <em>happen</em>.</p>

<h3>Why do we close a question?</h3>

<p>The philosophy of SE is that each site handles questions on <em>problems you face</em> or things you are trying to understand. The <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">don't ask</a> section of the help center gives you a good overview of things that don't work - to summarise:</p>

<ul>
<li>Some questions invite arguments or extended debate that suck up time when members could be helping other people.</li>
<li>Some questions are too broad, too narrow or have other content problems.</li>
<li>Some questions belong elsewhere.</li>
</ul>

<p>These have been worked out over time and with a lot of experience from Stack Overflow and are, <em>broadly speaking</em> true. Sometimes, exceptions are made - it is always a case-by-case thing.</p>

<h3>Is closing like deletion?</h3>

<p>No. Actually, deletion is a different concept on SE. Closed questions are put ""into improve mode"" if you like, and are still visible for <em>anyone</em> to improve. That's the idea. Deleted questions are different — they have a red background and are invisible to all but high reputation users. So deletion is different and solves a slightly different problem.</p>

<h3>What are the requirements for closing a question?</h3>

<p>If you have 3000 reputation, or 500 reputation on a beta site, you can vote to close any question for the reasons above. More on that in a moment.</p>

<p>If you do not have this level of reputation, you will find that under the flag menu, you have an option ""this question does not belong here"". That will raise a flag for users who can vote to close.</p>

<h3>Why can anyone vote to close/reopen?</h3>

<p>Firstly, anyone with sufficient reputation can vote to close or reopen (or flag as such, with lower reputation) because it is <em>your site</em>. This is really important - it's about expressing what you feel works and doesn't.</p>

<h3>Ok, so how does it work?</h3>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/qogGL.png"" alt=""Example close button""></p>

<p>Ok, the important piece. Voting to close works like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Underneath the question, there will be a close link. When you click on this, you will be presented with a list of options from which you can pick a close reason most appropriate to the situation.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/THms0.png"" alt=""Close vote reasons dialog""></p>

<ul>
<li>If other people have voted, you will see blue numbers against the reason they chose.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/69Kak.png"" alt=""Other votes""></p>

<ul>
<li>The exact duplicate page takes you to a page that allows you to specify a question to close as an exact duplicate against.</li>
<li>The ""off topic"" page will present you with two options - one to migrate here, to meta, and one just off topic. At the moment, only moderators can send questions elsewhere, so feel free to cast a vote here and flag if you have a target in mind - we are collecting statistics to build a ""migrate to"" list, but that is not implemented yet.</li>
<li>The other options are straight out closes.</li>
<li>Once you pick your option and click ""close"", your vote is registered. You cannot retract it at this stage, but nobody else, including moderators, will know it was you who voted.</li>
<li>If five people agree, the question will be closed. You've seen the effect of these before.</li>
<li>Your name, and the name of other closers, will appear on the bottom of the question.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/K3F4V.png"" alt=""Close banner""></p>

<h3>How does vote to re-open work?</h3>

<p>A closed question has a ""reopen"" link underneath it. If you click this, a dialog box will ask you if you are sure - click yes and your vote will be registered to re-open the question.</p>

<p>Below, you can see an example of the re-open link with two votes registered for re-opening (out of five).</p>

<p><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/syw4O.png"" alt=""Re-open link""></p>

<h3>What happens if I make a mistake?</h3>

<p>Don't worry! You can retract your close vote by clicking the “close” button again. This is useful, for example, if the question has been edited since you voted to close. Note that you cannot use this to change the close reason (if you retract a close vote, you can't cast a new one).</p>

<p>Furthermore, unless five people agree, or a moderator agrees, the question won't be closed. </p>

<h3>Why are some questions closed with fewer votes?</h3>

<p>Moderator close votes complete the required vote count immediately, no matter how many people have voted. This applies for both close/reopen votes.</p>

<p>Furthermore, closure as duplicate can be faster for two reasons. If the asker agrees that their question is a duplicate, they can validate the closure immediately. This shows a final duplicate close vote from “Community”. Also, if a user with a gold tag badge in one of the question's initial tags votes to close or reopen as a duplicate, this takes effect immediately; in this case a gold tag badge icon appears after the closer's name.</p>

<h3>I've seen a closed question and I disagree. What can I do?</h3>

<p>Well, one option is to use your re-open vote! You can also always raise a discussion here on meta to seek clarification on why a question is closed and hopefully either a resolution will be reached, or you will get an explanation for the closure. </p>

<h3>My name appears on the bottom. Isn't this going to cause problems with other users?</h3>

<p>Actually, surprisingly few closed questions generate any response at all.</p>

<p>However, if you experience difficulties as a result of closing a question, you can and should contact a moderator via the flag mechanism (which is anonymous). We can then take any necessary action.</p>

<h3>How do I find questions I might need to close? What about re-opens?</h3>

<p>In the <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review"">review queues</a>, specifically the <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/close"">close votes queue</a> and the <a href=""https://crypto.stackexchange.com/review/reopen"">reopen votes queue</a>. These queues are open to everyone who has the close vote privilege. For each question, you get to decide whether to close/reopen or not; enough “no” votes take the question out of the queue. An edit from the queue is a vote to not close or reopen.</p>

<h3>Note on shortcuts: <em>Magic links</em> and Relative paths</h3>
<p>It is possible to reduce the length of the comments, so that they fit, by using <em>shortcuts</em>. Note that the <code>[help]</code>, <code>[ask]</code>, <code>[answer]</code> and <code>[about]</code> tags (in the C&amp;P) expand into <em>Help Center</em>, <em>How to Ask</em>, <em>How to Answer</em> and <em>Tour</em> links, respectively - so the entire URL does <em>not</em> need to be specified.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[help]</code>   =&gt; <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help"">help center</a></li>
<li><code>[ask]</code>    =&gt; <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-ask"">How to Ask</a></li>
<li><code>[answer]</code> =&gt; <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/how-to-answer"">How to Answer</a></li>
<li><code>[about]</code> =&gt; <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/tour"">tour</a></li>

<li><code>[chat]</code> =&gt; <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/"">3D Printing Chat</a></li>
<li><code>[edit]</code> =&gt; Edit the post link</li>
</ul>
<p>N.B. <code>[tour]</code> and <code>[about]</code> are equivalent.</p>
<p>See <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/editing-help#comment-formatting"">comment formatting</a> for more information, or <em>better still</em>, see the <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/242306/369403"">Complete list of help center magic links</a>.</p>
<p>Also worthy of mention are <em>relative links</em>, so you can skip the <em>absolute URL</em> part (i.e. <code>https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com</code>). For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[Ask Question](/questions/ask)</code> =&gt; Ask Question link (at the top of the page)</li>
</ul>
<p>Just copy the relative part of the URL (to the page that you want to point to) from your browser.</p>

<p>Today however I came across this article, <a href=""https://www.engadget.com/2010/12/16/32-gb-versus-32gb-almost-everyone-is-writing-it-wrong/?guccounter=1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">32 GB versus 32GB: Almost everyone is writing it wrong</a>, by chance - I was actually looking up SD cards - and it summed up things pretty well. I'll let you read it. </p>

<p>However, the rules are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>non-breaking spaces (<code>&amp;nbsp;</code> / <code>ALT</code>+0160) before <em>all</em> SI units, including bytes</li>
</ul>

<p>Except:</p>

<ul>
<li>degrees (°), minutes ('), and seconds ("") (for angles)</li>
</ul>

<p>See also: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#General_rules"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Wikipedia: International System of units - Lexicographic conventions</a> :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The value of a quantity is written as a number followed by a space (representing a multiplication sign) and a unit symbol; e.g., 2.21&nbsp;kg, 7.3×10<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>, 22&nbsp;K. This rule explicitly includes the percent sign (%) and the symbol for degrees of temperature (°C). Exceptions are the symbols for plane angular degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ′, and ″), which are placed immediately after the number with no intervening space.</p>

<p>I must admit that <em>I</em> didn't realise that it applied to °C and %, as well... oops!</p>

<hr>

<p>In a <strong>comment</strong>, <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> does not work (nor does any HTML). Try <code>ALT+0160</code> - Or on Windows Ctrl+Shift+Spacebar (or on a Mac, type Option+Spacebar).</p>

<p>Note that it is best to stick with <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> in <strong>answers</strong> as the other options are <strong><em>impossible</em></strong> to see when editing - so the <code>&amp;nbsp;</code> serves as a nice visual clue.</p>

<p>According to SE.3D Printing user stats at <a href=""https://area51.stackexchange.com/proposals/82438/3d-printing"">Area 51</a> we need more questions and a solid group of users to assist in moderating the site. </p>

<p>The amount of questions are hard to control, but could be increased by the avid users by posting questions and answer those themselves (e.g. about problems you encountered while gaining experience in 3D printing, this is perfectly legal and documents the gained experience to be shared with others). Another aspect is the solid group of users. According to the stats page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We recommend: </p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>150 users with 200+ rep (currently 130 users with 200+ rep) </li>
  <li>10 users with 2,000+ rep (currently 10 users with 2,000+ rep) </li>

<p>This implies we are short on 200+ rep users (20 people). This can be influenced by voting! There are so many questions unaccepted and a few do not have an answer, so there is a lot of reputation points to be awarded.</p>

<p>Please vote, not only answers, but also on questions. Please do also downvote to keep the quality high, but leave a comment why you downvote, when this answer/question is then modified to address your concerns please revisit to review your vote again.</p>

318,2,2018-08-15T17:06:21.983,3,,"<p>Well done for bringing this up. I was looking at those numbers too. </p>

<p>Referring to <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/264/what-does-it-take-to-get-out-of-beta-stage/265#265"">this post</a>, almost all of the stats are improving (albeit) slowly, except for one, the ApQ </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are users put off by an expectation that a wrong answer might lose them rep?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems that way. Without wishing to provide a link to the actual comment, I noticed a comment the other day that suggested as much, and a nicely detailed comment was left instead. </p>

<p>To be fair, I feel that way sometimes, and often hesitate (maybe rightly so to save myself from spamming the site) in posting questions on SE.Meta, as there are a number of drive-by downvoters there<sup>1</sup>. Unless you have a definite bug that you are able to document clearly or have a well rounded proposal that can be implemented easily, then your question may end up downvoted. This is probably rightly so, TBH, in most cases, but nevertheless it can be discouraging.</p>

<p>If you don't have much hard-earned rep then you may be less willing to risk it by posting a informative answer, that only answers half the question.  Is that a bad thing? Well, it is a double edged sword. It is a good thing, because that promotes good solid answers, but with the downside that you point out (a lack of multiple answers per question).</p>

<p>What can we do? Probably, not much other than creating a small community by promoting a friendly environment and communicating more clearly... Inviting people to chat in the chatroom, being more welcoming (with Hi and welcome), actually helping people without the old ""Did you google this?"" immediately.  All of these things help a lot. And which we seem to have developed of late. So we seem to be getting there.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Questions that are too broad for which we have expertise</strong>. Example: <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6661/10684"">How to build the cheapest but safest laser engraver</a>. For these questions, we generally know how to respond properly, but the questions are so ill-defined, that the whole thread becomes a mess.</li>
<li><strong>Questions that are too broad for which we do not have expertise</strong>. Example: <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6640/10684"">Am I allowed to publish a 3d scan of a [Buddha] statue?</a>. These questions are formulated properly, but we lack the expertise, and so everybody chimes in with ""half knowledge"".</li>
<li><strong>Questions that are narrowly defined</strong>. Example: <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/6342/10684"">What voltage does the Creality Ender-3 run at?</a>. These questions can be solved with one answer.</li>
<li><strong>Questions that are well-defined, but have multiple solutions</strong>. Example: <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/4459/10684"">Noise Reduction</a>. These are some sort of ""medium size"" questions, neither too broad so as to invite opinions, but not too narrow so they can be completed with one answer.</li>
</ol>

<p>I think, to raise both the quality and the quantity of threads here, we should reduce questions of type 1 and 2, and promote questions of type 3 and 4.</p>

<p>In my opinion, posters of type 1 questions should be politely asked to narrow down their questions or, if not possible, marked as off-topic, closed, too broad or whatever designation exists. Type 2 questions should be moved to another Stack Exchange site.</p>

<p><strong>As for answers per questions</strong>: Clearly, type 4 questions are the ones, that will raise the answers-questions-ratio (without sacrificing quality).

323,2,2018-08-21T21:25:24.977,1,,"<p>Something to realize is, ApQ is one of the least dependent factors for graduation. I don't think this site lends to having a huge amount of ApQ's, because usually there is only going to really be one answer which will work. I think the ApQ category was based more towards the programming/tech sites. I mean, when programming, there's almost ALWAYS going to be more than one way to answer a question.Then when you look at other sites where there is advice given, like Travel.SE or Law.SE, you could possibly see a plethora of answers for each of their questions. Then you take WorldBuilding.SE and it's a whole new level.</p>

<p>IIRC, when Mechanics.SE graduated, we had sub 2.0 ApQ. I don't think 3D's is out of line with that and it isn't going to hurt the site for graduation.</p>

<p>While multi-ApQ is not a bad thing, it only works if the question deserves it. If the question isn't answered correctly or if there might be something else which could be the answer, then multi-ApQ is an awesome thing. To make answers for answer sake, just to boost the ApQ, that can be ugly. A much better idea is (IMHO), to upvote good Q/A's and downvote bad ones.</p>

<p>Too broad seems a bit of a mis-assessment, but I think it's maybe a mistake to ask where to find this information, since that does read a little bit like ""find me a link"". I think a better question would be to ask what are the basic design rules - and then worry if that is too broad.</p>

<p>We need to focus as a community on taking questions which don't quite fit, and improving them, otherwise we will not get people coming back with more questions and later helping others. There is still a focus amongst some members on only answering specific 'problem' questions, rather than generating a comprehensive resource covering the whole subject. SE intends to be the top search result (and presumably the answer and un-informed student was looking for).</p>

<p>Maybe 'design rules"" seems to broad, when you presumably care about the factors that are unique to FDM. (i.e. exclude all the general engineering principles which would be common to subtractive machining, injection moulding, etc. even though they are obviously still relevant). I feel this was kind of implicit in the question, but some may have been mislead by the terminology.</p>

<p>Should tolerances be included? With an electronics background rather than engineering, <code>Design Rules</code> implies a final sign-off stage check of low level trivial detail rather than the entry point to the design flow.</p>

<p>I think the question also suffers slightly from a <em>I have an answer in mind, so it seems that I'm asking the question in a way that leads to that answer</em>, kind of an X-Y of getting the answer posted (in this case, the answer is the true goal, not the question).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Tbm0115 - &quot;support-material&quot; should define the material-type (ie. PLA, ABS, PVA, etc.) which in FDM is usually the same as the print-material. However, in the case of machines like dual-extruders can be completely different. The print-material for the body of the part can be PLA while the support-material can be PVA.</p>
<p>Support-structure defines the &quot;style&quot; of structure that is generated by the slicer. For instance, I can have a scaffolding-like structure to support bridges and spire-like structure for small overhangs. Personally, I view infill as a subset of support-structure because it is material that is meant to support the overall body including ceilings. With infill I can have square, hexagonal, even cat-like styles of support structure.</p>
<p>Trish - I agree on the structure being more about style (Trees, pylons, towers, included in the design or not, everywhere or not) while support material is more a subset of filament - PVA is one of those, but also one could use (in a dual extruder) ABS on a PLA print, and then remove the supports with acetone or some other stuff. One might use a super low melting filament and remove with heat.</p>

<p>which is as 0scar has already stated, i.e. TPU ∈ TPE. It goes on to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Although technically classed under the ThermoPlastic Elastomer
spectrum, the full name for TPU is ThermoPlastic Polyurethane. This
isn’t especially new in industry, but until recently wasn’t commonly
available in 3D printing.</p>
<p>However recently it’s growing a lot more popularity among printers.
While on the surface very similar to TPE, but TPU 3D printing has some
notable differences.</p>
<p>TPU is very similar in elasticity and other mechanical properties to
TPE. Although it is very slightly more rigid, at Shore 94A-95A. This
makes it a little easier to print in printers that don’t usually print
the original, softer TPE 3D printing filament well, as the slight more
rigidity is easier for the extruder mechanism to handle.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So they don't seem <em><strong>exactly</strong></em> the same. I dunno, I'm not sure. However, we apparently have the tags already, so that isn't a major issue anymore.</p>
<p>With regards to the synonym aspect: Are the questions going to to be the same, i.e. will the same issues happen to both TPU and TPE, or will TPU have special, particular issues? If the latter, then a synonym maybe isn't a good idea.</p>

It is the model that is sliced where the settings act upon, frequently this is where people make mistakes. Also, successfully extruding filament in the ""air"" does not guarantee success in printing, the difference is stressing or pressurising the filament path, hence a model should be included.</p>

<p>I remember a long conversation on the Ultimaker forums a few months ago about this very proposal: being able to export settings in some form, to make it easier for people who are experimenting to follow the various iterations of settings more easily.</p>

<p>Some people asked for text format, csv, odt, etc, but the people of Ultimaker ultimately crushed the hopes of everyone by explaining, in technical terms that I did not completely understood, that it wasn't possible without rebuilding the whole thing from scratch.</p>

<p>I agree about the posting of the entire configuration file or G-code in a question is too big to fit, etc. What is really needed, and I've thought this for a long time, is a SE sanctioned version of PasteBin [functionality]. A persistent scrapbook/scratchpad site internal to SE (like the i.stack.imgur.com site) where <em>over-sized</em> chunks of code/configs/text can be pasted, without it being an external link (which carry the inherent risk of link death).

<p><code>(formingMethod == additive OR substractive) AND (instrument == machine)</code></p>

<p>Off-topic would have the formula:</p>

<p><code>(formingMethod == transformative) OR (scale == mass) OR (instrument == human)</code></p>

<p>This is just my suggestion and I invite everyone to put forward their argument, if they think, that a better strategy or community can be created, if the boundaries are to be moved or the criteria re-defined.</p>

<p>Vacuum forming on an individual/batch scale, for example, would be a topic, that is close to the other ""green fields"". If we want vacuum forming to be on-topic, we would have to give up the ""transformative"" criteria. I'm sure, there are other points like this.</p>

<p>As a case in point, (as well as playing devil's advocate) seeing as I still (rather embarrassingly) haven't got around to actually finish <em>building</em> any physical printer, but I <em>have</em> extensively rummaged around in the various firmware out there (as well as coming from an programming/Arduino background), currently I'd, rather ironically, find the <strong>advanced</strong> and <strong>complicated</strong> fixes easier to do than the <strong>simple things</strong> that you listed. </p>

<p>However, I know that I'm not representative of the average <em>just-bought-a-printer-and-now-have-a-problem</em> type user and for those users, your list and ordering probably makes much more sense. The ordering would also be equally valid for a <em>printer-builder</em> user, as they are for a <em>straight-out-of-the-box</em> user, I guess.</p>

<p>However, I don't know if we can <em>expect</em> any user of the site to have any <em>particular</em> certain level of expertise. I guess that can only be ascertained by the reading of their question and how they answer any follow up questions that might get raised, in the comments. Only thereafter could any answers be tailored to best match their level of understanding.</p>

<p>So, I guess what I'm saying is that a guideline would be good/interesting/cool to have, be what happens if a certain user doesn't have that rough level of expertise which is expected? We would still have to play it by ear, as we have been doing so, I think is the answer.</p>

They could fill out the blanks in this, as these are pretty much readable from the slicer and machine:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't know how exactly to request it, but I do want to point at one
  pretty big downside.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The player is pretty darn big.</strong> Plus, my experience is that it has a tendency to eat CPU cycles for breakfast.</p>
  
  <p>I looked at the numbers <a href=""https://space.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/883/are-there-ways-to-make-posts-with-images-better-for-low-connect-speed-users-doe/885#comment3547_885"">about a year ago over on Space Exploration

  What I found was:</p>
  
  <blockquote>
    <p>Loading <a href=""https://space.stackexchange.com/q/21891/415"">https://space.stackexchange.com/q/21891/415</a> without using the browser cache downloads 7642 KB for me just now. Of that,
    <code>www.youtube.com</code> is responsible for 3182 KB and <code>i.stack.imgur.com</code>
    another 2729 KB. Excluding just the embedded images and the
    video-related downloads leaves about 1.7 MB to be downloaded. That's
    still a sizable chunk of data for what basically amounts to a few
    pages of text, but not quite as extreme as 7.6 MB.</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>So one video embed adds about 3 MB download for everyone viewing the
  post, regardless of whether or not they are in any way interested in
  the video. (I think the video itself is downloaded on demand, so if
  someone actually watches the video, that adds even more data, but at
  that point at least they have some interest in it.) In situations
  where connections are metered by the megabyte, this can add up
  quickly, and is something that should be kept in mind before turning
  on this feature. Not everyone is on a fast,
  no-extra-charge-per-megabyte connection.</p>
  
  <p>(Yes, I'm big on keeping text as mostly text. I'm old-fashioned in
  that regard.)</p>

<p>Also <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/c/moderators/questions/257#answer-260"">this post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Are there any downsides to having embedded video (performance or otherwise)?</p>
  </blockquote>
  
  <p>Yep, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/279637/295232"">performance could be an issue</a>. Also, malicious users could post links to videos with ... questionable ... content (though this could be alleviated by requiring some reputation to post embedded videos, just as some sites do with pictures).</p>

<p>So, if someone posts an answer that regurgitates a mis-understanding, commonly held belief, an internet myth, or what have you, <em>that has been <strong>proven</strong> to be wrong</em>, then that answer should most certainly <strong>not</strong> be deleted, but held up as an example of inaccuracy - not to vilify the poster, but rather to re-educate, and hopefully try to stop the self-perpetuating inaccurate fact/myth in its tracks. To do that a down-vote, in conjunction with a comment, can help to do that. </p>

<p>Note that a downvote alone, without at least one comment, will not - as the poster probably won't understand why they are getting downvoted and just assume that it's some sort of vendetta.</p>

<h3>Related Note</h3>

<p>There is some confusion with <em>Not an answer</em> (NAA) and <em>Low quality answer</em> (LQA), of which a technically inaccurate answer (as described above) is neither.</p>

<p>This is how a I personally interpret the flags:</p>

<ul>
<li>NAA:

<ul>
<li>A comment</li>
<li>Another question</li>
<li>A ""Me Too!""</li>
<li>A post that basically contains no answer whatsoever</li>
</ul></li>
<li>LQA:

<ul>
<li>Random letters</li>
<li>Ranting</li>
<li>Any other utter nonsense</li>
<li>Dead link</li>
<li>A post that no matter how you edit it, contains no information</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>By embedding the former only, then this serves the immediacy of the situation, that is to say, to help the OP resolve their issue. Links to third party tutorials, product demonstrations, etc., can be watched, after clicking the link, in separate windows - at the viewer's leisure, without having to tax the back-end servers needlessly, with inline video.</p>

<p>Obviously exceptions will arise, but hopefully these will be kept to a minimum.</p>

In and of itself, as you've stated it, it could be anything from what to expect to giving them service recommendations (ie: <em>What's a good place to get xxxx done?</em> or <em>Who provides to best services in the Dallas, TX area?</em>) This isn't the only place where it could be done.

415,2,2019-06-10T19:03:16.273,1,,"<p>My perspective is this is more of a ""is it illegal to buy illegal things"" is not exactly bound to 3d printing.

<p>Honestly I feel that any legal questions should not be handled here unless it's extremely specialized to 3d printing. Copyrights counterfeits and IP are ubiquitous in almost all things sold, so this is not a good candidate. For me, I wouldn't touch a question like this, as if someone gives bad advice, they could potentially be liable, or put stack overflow in a bad situation. (I assume the TOS covers some liability cases). That all seems to be more better suited the <a href=""https://law.stackexchange.com/"">Law Stack exchange</a>. The existence of the stack exchange is the deciding part for me, a community better suited to ask questions related to trade laws. </p>

<p>However. To me this is the same as asking about a woodburning kit question in an electronics forum, because they both use soldering irons. If we allow a removal base machines, such as lasers, we will also have to allow discussions about CNC machines.</p>

<p>In the case of that question, they would get bonus points if it was a pure gcode question. Maybe even if it was on a multi use machine.. Instead its asking us to debug their laser setup. Thats not really formatted for stackoverflow anyways. They need to go to a forum. Also as someone that once made a Cheap Chinese laser cutter use a RAMPS 1.4 board, I know exactly how similar they are.

Small edits are sometimes necessary to get out some spelling and unit spacing errors to improve the layout and readability of the questions and answers. I think the edits to the software name are born from my own experiences and nuisance as an owner of a software product that is misspelled many, many times, even by my own management... You've definitely got a point when it is seen as a nuisance and should therefore not be done anymore. </p>

<p>Do note that the software initially was called Cura and the name was changed by the developers to explicitly include the company name at some point (version 2.something), hence the changes. I guess it would be best to use the complete name when one refers to the installment version, but can be shortened when referred to in text.</p>

<p>We've just expanded the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/on-topic"">on-topic page</a>, with areas that were initially vague and unclear as to whether they were on topic or not, and which, over time, became clear that they should be on-topic. The initial proposal of the expansion was illustrated here, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/276/game-plan-what-is-on-topic?rq=1"">Game plan</a>, and the final update was posted here, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/413/on-topic-has-been-updated-finally"">On-topic has been updated - finally!</a>.</p>

<p>So, if your questions are on that (new, expanded) list then yes, they are on-topic. Otherwise, if they get posted they may get close votes, but then again people might find the question useful and run with it. It's up to the community really.</p>

<p>Sorry, if this answer is a bit vague and I can't be more specific (at the moment).</p>

<p>However, IMHO, I think that the site is intended to be more about the mechanics of 3D printing and getting something printed, rather than what you can do with 3D printed objects, as the latter is a extremely broad area, unbounded even. But others <em>may</em> have a more broader, and more accommodating, view. </p>

448,2,2019-11-18T16:27:18.130,1,,"<p>Well posted. </p>

<p>I agree. Whilst I know that other people's opinions do and will differ, myself, I feel that this is on-topic. After all it is not an open-ended recommendation, but rather ""is this suitable?"" Personally, I can't see what is wrong with it and we have quite a few of questions like it, that haven't been closed. </p>

<p>TBH, this particular question has been playing on my mind ever since it was migrated, and it is a shame if we can't help people with these sort of questions.</p>

<p>I feel like maybe posting a ""Why can't we allow (non-open ended) product suitability questions/recommendations"" meta question, although your question has already done this, I guess.</p>

<p>I know that SE.Electrical Engineering has a similar type of thought process, and I have previously posted some questions asking ""Can I use this component?"" or (more tenuously) ""What can I use to replace such and such a component?"" and they were closed almost immediately - I'll have to dig around to find the examples - and it was quite frustrating that I couldn't get an answer, and I didn't really know where else to turn.  Admittedly, the latter question was/is open-ended... however, if I suggest a component and ask as to its suitability, I personally can't see what is wrong with that, as it isn't open-ended, and more of a yes/no binary question.</p>

<p>I guess one could say that it invites opinionated answers - a bit like my answer to the stepper motor question, which after re-reading could be read as just my opinion, I suppose.</p>

<p>Even so, it is still a shame as it would tend to put people (especially new comers) off from approaching SE again, as they may perceive that SE has a rather strict set of guidelines as to what can be asked and what can not. However, that is more down to SE's rules as a whole, which we can't really debate here.</p>

<p>However, that said, it isn't like this particular SE site is so inundated with questions that we can't bend the rules a bit. Most of the time we are lucky to get one or two questions a day...</p>

<p>At least it wasn't closed immediately and the OP was offered some guidance in the comments and answers before it got closed. Well done to all for that.</p>

<hr>

<p>This has been a bit of a brain dump of what has been on my mind the past day, hopefully it doesn't sound like a rant (it isn't meant to be). I'll go over it later and modify and supplement, when I get more time.</p>

with this site. E.g. material printing temperatures, cooling,

Your first example is usually Off Topic (unless it's an assembly for a printer component), while the second is somewhat careful to look at: How to prepare a surface for further postprocessing is usually filament dependent and thus in scope.

<p>Is the intention of SE that questioners (within one particular activity they undertake) will tend to ask questions on one site, or do we expect sites to have very narrow, non-overlapping scopes and place the onus on questioners to determine the correct site?</p>

<p>In other words, if I cross-country ski and also 3D Print, clearly questions about each activity should go to different sites.  But, within cross-country skiing, would questions about waxing be directed to a materials science site, questions about packing the snow be directed to a landscaping site?  Or, would they all fit within cross-country skiing?</p>

<p>I know this isn't a clear answer.  To the extent that I may take a position, I would encourage someone who has found this site to stick here until they clearly can be better served elsewhere.</p>

<p>Basically, every printer consists of a frame with some sort of guide rails<sup>1</sup> moving a carriage. On this carriage a build surface is attached where the printer prints the print on; it is always the top of the stack. Note that this can be e.g. a moving Y-axis<sup>2</sup> or moving Z-axis carriage<sup>3</sup>. In some cases the carriage is missing and there is just a static mounting, then it's a platform instead<sup>4</sup>. It is basically irrelevant if the build surface is glued to the stack or removeable in some way or another.</p>
<p>Between the carriage and the build surface you can have have a stack of multiple elements: a structure or structures, a plate, plates or matts, insulation, etc. This <strong>whole</strong> assembly of elements make up the build platform, an example is shown below.</p>

<p>How should menu items in software, i.e. Cura, or settings, i.e. 'Layer Height', be formatted?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h3>Formatting menu items</h3>
<p>I normally use Bold. However, I have seen other people use italics. It's probably best to stick to one or the other. Shall we say Bold? I (personally) prefer bold as it seems clearer to me.</p>
<p>Italics would be more suited for use as <em>stressing</em> a point or a <em>particular</em> word, IMHO.</p>
<p>For a menu delimiter, I normally use this character: <code>►</code> (<code>&amp;#x25B6;</code>), as it (again) is clearer to see. So for example a hierarchical menu would look like:</p>
<p><strong>File</strong> ► <strong>Print...</strong></p>
<p>or</p>
<p><strong>View</strong> ► <strong>Developer</strong> ► <strong>View Source</strong></p>
<p>Note: that the arrow is not bolded, here is the actual markdown:</p>
<pre><code>**View** ► **Developer** ► **View Source**`
</code></pre>
<p>I've also seen code formatting used for menus, but IMHO, I think it looks nasty, see <a href=""https://arduino.stackexchange.com/a/18/6936"">this answer</a> (which, incidentally, is where I lifted the arrow from).</p>
<hr />
<p>Note: This is not an official &quot;Stack Exchange&quot; policy (I'm not even sure that one exists, w.r.t. formatting menu items or what-have-you). I <em>did</em> come across this today, however: <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303219/4424636"">How do I make a good edit?</a>, which has a <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/303220/4424636"">good answer</a> from <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/users/168333/s-l-barth-reinstate-monica"">S.

It could be stock, but it could be something different as well, the OP doesn't mention it. You are totally right to assume that this is Marlin, but it could be different (but not likely).</p>
<p>The stock firmware is Marlin of the Ender 3, which is probably on about 80-90 % of all printers. With &quot;site&quot; in the comment is meant the RepRap website that is linked, not the 3DP.SE site. Please note that the RepRap website is not firmware specific, you can find more firmware flavors, hence the reference to point to that reference. Maybe a comment on the question if the printer is running stock firmware would have made things more clear, I should have asked that, my bad. But the answer doesn't contain a firmware specific reference, it is in comments only. Comments are transient and are frequently deleted.</p>

<p>Direct-Ink-Writing (DIW) is an extrusion-based additive manufacturing method heavily utilized in meso- and micro-scales.

<p>MEW utilizes an electric field uniquely coupled with AM technology for the controlled deposition of a molten polymer jet, which rapidly solidifies into a fiber.

<p>If you do not award your bounty within 7 days (plus the grace period), the highest voted answer created after the bounty started with a minimum score of 2 will be awarded half the bounty amount (or the full amount, if the answer is also accepted). &gt;If two or more eligible answers have the same score (their scores are tied), the oldest answer is chosen. If there's no answer meeting those criteria, no bounty is awarded to anyone.</p>
<p>If the bounty was started by the question owner, and the question owner accepts an answer posted during the bounty period, and the bounty expires without an explicit award then we assume the bounty owner liked the answer they accepted and award it the full bounty amount at the time of bounty expiration.</p>

But the good news is <strong>you now officially only need 3 close votes to close a question on 3D Printing SE!</strong></p>
<p>After looking at the data, I think it's clear that there's no reason for y'all to have this set at 5. Thank you so much for bearing with us while we got to this request.</p>
<p>We'll check back in with you all in a few months to see how things are going — if things are going great, we may not post an update but please feel free to leave a comment if you want us to post something.</p>
<p>Here's some basic stats of how things look:</p>
<p>Over the last two years, you've had heavy fluctuations in effectiveness, when looking into what percentage of questions that received at least one flag or vote to close actually ended up getting closed. As you can see, the effectiveness is in the 60%~100% range — the good news is that the numbers of posts this represents are relatively small (always under 20 posts per month).</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iT5UH.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/iT5UH.png"" alt=""Graph showing the percentage of handled tasks, as described in the paragraph above"" /></a></p>
<p>The graph below, however, does show something that is a bit more concerning:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/922SP.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/922SP.png"" alt=""Graph showing all closed posts, posts closed by the community, and posts closed by the moderation team. The line representing posts closed by the moderation team matches the line of all closed posts on almost all of the reporting period"" /></a></p>
<p>This shows that the moderation team is doing the bulk of the closing, which can be problematic because the mods shouldn't be making these decisions on their own, even with other users weighing in. To add a bit more nuance, though, it looks like the moderation is not <em>single-handedly</em> closing the posts, but rather stepping in to aid the community on a big chunk of cases — the graph below shows which vote the moderators cast, to close posts:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DeBm.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/6DeBm.png"" alt=""Graph showing the amount of times mods cast the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, or 5th vote to close questions on the site"" /></a></p>
<p>When working on this project, Catija had found two primary use cases for this change:</p>
<ol>
<li>When too many items are going unhandled (not unclosed, just unhandled)</li>
<li>When the moderators are doing the bulk of the closing/reopening.</li>
</ol>
<p>Because the mods here are casting the bulk of the final close votes, the first graph looks good (at least in the months where 100% effectiveness is reached). However, this creates an imbalance between closing and reopening as the mods now have to be really thoughtful about reviewing for reopening.</p>
<p>So, my hope is that changing this to three votes to close/reopen will take some of the workload off the mods and also increase the number of posts that find their way to be reopened - assuming it's worth reopening them!</p>

<p>After asking about, there seems to be two sites that <em>might</em> be good candidates<sup>1</sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engineering
<ul>
<li>Tag: <a href=""https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/cad"">CAD</a></li>
<li>Tag: <a href=""https://engineering.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/solidworks"">Solidworks</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Graphic Design
<ul>
<li>Tag: <a href=""https://graphicdesign.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d"">3D</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>IMHO, SE.Engineering would seem to be the best location, although it probably depends upon the practical application described by the question. That is to say, if the design is for a logo of a company, then SE.GraphicDesign is probably a better fit.</p>
<p>There is a SE.Computer Graphics (tag: <a href=""https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d?tab=newest&amp;page=2&amp;pagesize=15"">3D</a>) but that would seem to be more for coding and low-level stuff. I would say that SE.Mathematics is definitely a &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<h3>Blender</h3>
<p>Obviously, if the question is about Blender then <a href=""https://blender.stackexchange.com/"">SE.Blender</a> is a perfect fit. Blender is a special case as it already has a dedicated SE site. They <em>also</em> have a <a href=""https://blender.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3d-printing"">tag for 3d-printing</a>.</p>
<h3>External sites</h3>
<p>Another alternative is Reddit, for example</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/Fusion360"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">reddit.com/r/Fusion360</a></li>

<p>It shouldn't be too long, as you have already noted, but it also should <strong>not</strong> just point out the obvious.

<p>as it is not only obvious but also adds nothing that the name of the tag doesn't already provide.</p>
<p>I would suggest that it would be better to put:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>Basically, if it is obviously what the tag refers to, then point out what the tag is <em>not</em> meant to be used for -  in order to prevent its misuse...</p>
<p>However, if the tag name is somewhat obscure then clearly it would be a good idea to spell out what it should be used for.</p>
<p>Clearly, the line between obvious and not obvious could be a bit of a grey area, and not distinct, depending upon the tag.</p>

574,2,2023-05-24T21:54:32.973,2,,"<p>TL;DR - I agree with the proposal</p>
<hr />
<p><em>Note that I found it was rather difficult to formulate an answer to this question, without making it sound negative, opinionated and panic inducing. In fact I decided to remove quite a bit, and just leave in factual links and quotes.</em></p>
<hr />
<p>I came across this meta question over on SO today, <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/421880/4424636"">How can we determine whether an answer used ChatGPT?</a>, and <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/421946/4424636"">this answer</a> in particular grabbed my attention:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't think there's going to be any value in having <em><strong>you</strong></em>, a mere mortal, try to determine if an answer or question was generated by ChatGPT.</p>
<p>The reason is super, super simple: <strong>we don't want this to turn into a witch hunt</strong>.</p>
<p>There are things you can do even today to help with curation of answers; if an answer is wrong or incomplete, you can downvote it. If you <em>happen</em> to notice a trend of similarly bad answers from an account, you can flag for moderator attention with the series of answers you've got as evidence.</p>
<p>This shouldn't be a &quot;those bad answers are more moderatable than others&quot; situation - just vote on answers as you always would, and let the moderators deal with the heavier lifting on this circumstance.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Which raises a valid point of allowing <em>suspicion and doubt</em> to get the better of us.</p>
<p>Yes, we have recently seen some questionable posts, and (to be frank) even now I am still not 100% convinced what the <em>root</em> cause of those posts were.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, community voting and flagging seem to allow us to handle such situations reasonably well.</p>
<p>However, one thing that is certain: ChatGPT, and any other derivatives, are not going to go away, and it is probably going to become more and more difficult, as time goes by and the technology &quot;improves&quot;, to detect such posts.</p>
<p>The tools that you used (and refer to in your question), while I haven't tried them myself, look useful - even though they themselves would <em>also</em> appear to be using some sort of artificial decision making! The best tools are probably our own eyes and knowledge to root out suspect sentences and phrasing as well as (more importantly) suspect advice.</p>
<p>In addition, a couple of answers (to the linked to meta SO question) also point out some good tips and what to look for - such as <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/422561/4424636"">this answer</a> and the first paragraph of <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/422063/4424636"">this answer</a>, in particular.</p>

<p>Yes, the on-topic subjects are maybe wider that the original &quot;3D Printing site&quot; concept. However, IMHO, changing the name at this late stage <em>might</em> be a bit drastic (possibly during beta stage is the latest opportunity for a name change?)... plus, the majority of the questions that hit the site are still <em>predominately</em> about 3D printing, as the first line of the on-topic page states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Please make sure that your questions are intrinsically 3D printing oriented.</strong></p>

<p>3D scanning and 3D design <em>are</em> on-topic here, so long as the end result is (stated to be) a 3D printed model.</p>

<p>Similar concerns about the size of the community have been raised for many years, as the links below show.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Migration</h3>
<h4>General</h4>
<p>It is worth remembering that <em>migration</em> only has a rather small window (of a few days or so) after which a question is deemed &quot;too old to migrate&quot; and the option just greyed out (or unavailable, I forget which now)... annoying I know, but those are the rules.</p>
<p>IMHO, migration is pointless (and can require &quot;back-channel&quot; communication and agreements between sites) and just not worth the bother. Generally, it is much more simpler and efficient (and rapid) to just ask the poster to delete their question on the first site and just re-post it themselves on the new site.</p>
<p>A <em>very</em> similar question was asked recently on the Robotics Meta, please read <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1475/9176"">Can/should questions on Stack Overflow about ROS be migrated here?</a>. The <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/a/1476/9176"">answer</a> seems to also apply to this site and (more or less) re-iterates what I said above.</p>
<p>Also, <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/a/137931/280335"">this answer</a> to <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/136537/280335"">Is &quot;Too old to migrate&quot; a good reason NOT to migrate?</a> is really useful.</p>
<h4>Other sites</h4>
<p>I looked at some of the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/search?q=gcode"">G-code questions on SO</a> and a number of them are related to simply programmatic issues, parsing issues or substitution, that don't have a 3D Printing end-game, and so they wouldn't be on-topic anyway.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://robotics.stackexchange.com/"">Robotics site</a> was in a real lull until quite recently, when the <a href=""https://robotics.meta.stackexchange.com/q/1501/9176"">ROS (Q&amp;A) community was merged</a>. In the past some 3D printing questions <em>were</em> posted there, and I <em>did</em> think about getting those migrated, but then the OP had a meltdown and rage-quit, so that was the end of that.</p>
<p>The <a href=""https://engineering.stackexchange.com/"">Engineering site</a> also has some 3D design/modelling questions that <em>could</em> have fitted here, but (as has been <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/80216/can-i-ask-the-same-question-on-more-than-one-stack-exchange-site#:%7E:text=Ask%20on%20the%20site%20you,is%20a%20very%20bad%20idea."">stated elsewhere</a>) it is OK for some overlap to exist between SE sites, a question might be suited to <em>more than one site</em> and it doesn't really matter where it lands - the question just gets slightly re-jigged for the appropriate audience.</p>
<h3>Traffic</h3>
<p>There are graphs and spreadsheets and databases that can be queried to give you this sort of info. Early numbers can be seen in <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/265/4762"">this (now rather ramshackle) answer</a> to <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/264/4762"">What does it take to get out of Beta stage?</a>.</p>
<p>Also (vaguely) related are questions discussing participation:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/511/4762"">New users aren&#39;t posting their own questions - are we scaring them off?</a></li>
<li>more to be added as they are found...</li>
</ul>
<h4>A subjective view</h4>
<p>I have had the (possibly unjustified) <em>feeling</em> that the site has tailed off since early 2022 or so (as I noted at the end of <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/557/4762"">this answer</a> to <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/556/4762"">Is 3dprinting.stackexchange.com likely to still be active in the foreseeable future?</a>).</p>
<p>My <em>overall impression</em> is that this site was vibrant and had at least 10+ permanently active users, seven years ago, back in 2016. The questions back then seemed to be more related to:</p>
<ul>
<li>building DIY printers;</li>
<li>fixing Prusa printers and their clones;</li>
<li>filament queries;</li>
<li>general Arduino questions, and;</li>
<li>firmware issues.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, 3D printing has become much more mainstream, in the past few years, there are many more reliable manufacturers of printers that (apparently) just &quot;work out of the box&quot; and less people are building from scratch. So, less questions... apart from the initial flurry of Creality support questions<sup>1</sup>, when these printers first started to become popular (4-5 years ago?).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, even these types of questions seem to have tailed off, now, after a <em>subsequent</em> flurry of questions about Creality add-ons, such as the BLTouch (et al).</p>
<p>Also, w.r.t. repair, as 0scar states, most of the tinkering and repairing questions have already been asked and answered, back in the days of DIY printers. However, now and again a good old-fashioned board repair question comes along that you can get your teeth into, but they are becoming increasingly infrequent.</p>
<p>Nowadays, we <em>seem</em> to be down to a core of 4 or 5 regular visitors and  a few other less-regular users.</p>
<h5>Chat room</h5>
<p>I've just remembered that we also have a vibrant chat room (<em>two</em> in fact, see <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/307/4762"">Do we have a chatroom?</a>), which were active in 2018 onwards, and (after having just checked) the <a href=""https://chat.stackexchange.com/rooms/79830/public-3d-printing-room"">Public 3D Printing chatroom</a> still is.</p>
<h3>Promotion</h3>
<p>There was the opportunity to advertise our site, using community ads, but I'm not sure what ever came of that.</p>
<p>See:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/76/community-ads-lets-make-2d-ads-for-ourselves"">Community Ads! Let&#39;s make 2d ads for ourselves!</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/384/4762"">Advertising on other SE sites: 2019 Version</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, this question has (sort of) been asked before, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/74/4762"">How do we get more traffic to the site?</a></p>
<h3>Voting</h3>
<p>You <em>do</em> raise a good point: No votes makes it hard to <em>sort the wheat from the chaff</em>.</p>
<p>Again, the voting (or apparent lack thereof) has been raised in the past, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/176/how-do-we-motivate-users-to-vote-and-advertise-the-voting-policy"">How do we motivate users to vote and advertise the voting policy?</a></li>

<li><a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/196/remember-to-vote"">Remember to vote!</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Although, all of these seem to be from 2016. I really thought that there were a couple more recently asked questions... but maybe there aren't.</p>

586,2,2023-11-27T16:12:58.447,2,,"<p>I can't speak for the other reviewers of your suggested edits, but...</p>
<p>Possibly, at first glance at your links, I would avoid just changing the title into a question (from an already grammatically correct statement) on an <em>old established</em> question - as this adds little to the post and just bumps the question (again).</p>
<p>From your examples: #1, #2, #4 and #5 just seem to change a couple of words, but with little (or no) added value - apart from making a grammatical question, which isn't really strictly necessary. Many sites use title statements rather than questions - to be honest, either seem acceptable, so just changing titles (of old questions) into grammatically correct interrogations seems unnecessary. You could do that for the new posts, as they aren't yet established - but if you are trying to look up an older question and the title has been changed, then that could be taken as &quot;making the post more confusing&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, there are <em>a lot</em> of question titles that aren't questions (but statements instead), and converting them <em>all</em> would mean a lot of suggested edit reviews - all for little to no gain.</p>
<p>Focusing on #5 for a moment, adding the &quot;Longer LK5 Pro&quot; to the title is <em>redundant</em> as the question is already tagged with <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/longer-lk5"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;longer-lk5&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;longer-lk5&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-longer-lk5-tooltip-container"">longer-lk5</a>. Generally, when a question is tagged with &quot;<em>something</em>&quot;, that &quot;<em>something</em>&quot; is then <em>removed</em> from the title due to redundancy (see the section <strong>Avoid putting tags in the question title</strong> under <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/a/303220/4424636"">this answer</a> to <a href=""https://meta.stackoverflow.com/q/303219/4424636"">How do I make a good edit?</a>).</p>
<p>That said, your example #3 does seem useful as it does (admittedly) describe the issue better. That was one that I rejected, purely because (IIRC) it is an old question that already has an answer (that probably should have been accepted, had the user returned to the site after posting the question).</p>
<p>Actually, sticking with #3, the &quot;<em>with TMC2208 and Klipper</em>&quot; in the title should be removed as it is redundant, due to the tags (going by what was said above), which (by those rules) would leave the title as just:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Creality Sprite Extruder custom install on Ender 3 Pro</p>
</blockquote>
<p>which <em>really</em> is <em>utterly meaningless</em>! LOL. :-) So, maybe the <em>part</em> of your suggested edit that includes the voltage is a very good idea - even though the answer then states that the voltages should be ignored - so something like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How to configure the TMC2208 Driver Voltage for a Creality Sprite Extruder custom install</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and maybe tag with <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ender-3-pro"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ender-3-pro&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;ender-3-pro&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-ender-3-pro-tooltip-container"">ender-3-pro</a>, if there is one, otherwise the existing <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ender-3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ender-3&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;ender-3&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-ender-3-tooltip-container"">ender-3</a> tag might suffice..? However, I'm not sure how the Ender printers are meant to be tagged, and I might be wrong. There was a Meta post/discussion somewhere by Trish and/or 0scar about a possible hierarchy of tags, i.e. something <em>like</em> <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/creality"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;creality&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;creality&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-creality-tooltip-container"">creality</a> and<a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/ender"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;ender&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;ender&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-ender-tooltip-container"">ender</a> and then <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/3"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;3&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;3&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-3-tooltip-container"">3</a>, which I think was rejected - however, I've had a good look and really can't find the meta post.</p>
<p>So, in summary, I would reject all of those edits again, apart from #3 as the title is a bit of a mess anyway - remove the redundant already tagged info from the title and mention the stepper driver voltages. If you suggest that edit, I'll accept it :-)</p>
<h3>Suggestions</h3>
<p>As this is a small site (with little traffic, as discussed in your <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/582/4762"">previous meta post</a>), most of the questions have been edited to death already and as such, it can be difficult to find things to fix. It is probably best to stick to <strong>new posts</strong> that haven't yet been edited, or if an older post is blatantly incorrect and has been missed then that should be fixed.</p>
<p>You might find this useful: <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/500/4762"">Useful things to check for when cleaning up posts</a></p>
<p>I notice that you've added some tags in other suggested edits. Many of these tags have no description, which can make it a bit harder to review the suggested edit, w.r.t the validity of the tag.  If you could edit such &quot;empty&quot; tags, with descriptions and usage, that would be <em>really</em> useful. In which case, these are related:</p>

<h4>The problem with mods doing reviews</h4>
<p>As there really are <em>so few</em> regular users on the site, the review queues often fall to the moderators - otherwise they would never be cleared.</p>
<p>One issue with mods undertaking reviews, is that we are <em>unable</em> to vote as normal users, see <a href=""https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/41062/280335"">Add a way for moderators to cast a normal, non binding close/open vote</a>. That means that only one vote of ours is needed, which <em>seems</em> very undemocratic. I'm not happy about this, and would much prefer to have a community of votes, as is the usual case.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we don't have that luxury, and so some votes may seem autocratic in nature. However, as you have done, bringing up any perceived slight is always a good idea, and raising them here in Meta is always good for a discussion.</p>

587,2,2023-11-27T20:58:56.627,3,,"<h3>Image sizes</h3>
<p>One thing that I have noticed is that you change the URL of an image (taking this <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/review/suggested-edits/17538"">suggested edit</a> as an example), from:</p>
<pre><code>[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVE.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>to</p>
<pre><code>[1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVEm.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>However, if you do that, then, <em>when you click on the image</em>, to view the high resolution image, you are presented with an inferior lower-res image. Try clicking this image below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVEm.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""This is a low res image""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVEm.jpg"" alt=""This is a low res image"" title=""This is a low res image"" /></a></p>
<p>Now, if you click this image, you will get a superior image and better detail (which is always useful):</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVE.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" title=""This is a hi res image""><img src=""https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVE.jpg"" alt=""This is a hi res image"" title=""This is a hi res image"" /></a></p>
<p>Also, the top image <em>seems</em> a bit too small in the overall scheme of the post, IMHO.</p>
<p>However, if you like that &quot;smallness&quot; but still want to be able to click to a higher resolution image then you'd have to reference <em>two image URLs</em>, one for each size, something like this:</p>
<pre><code>[![Extruder][1]][2]

...

  [1]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVEm.jpg &quot;Extruder&quot;
  [2]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVE.jpg
</code></pre>
<p>This seems a bit too convoluted for my liking though, and might get messed up when other URLs (links and images) are added by the editor - not sure, not tested it. It would be good if it did get handled correctly though.</p>
<hr />
<h3>Adding image hover tags</h3>
<p>One other thing, after the image URL, if you repeat the image description in quotes, like this:</p>
<pre><code>[![This is a hi res image][3]][3]

...

  [3]: https://i.stack.imgur.com/SoOVE.jpg &quot;This is a hi res image&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>when you hover the mouse cursor over the image, the usually invisible (and seemingly pointless) image description now shows up in a &quot;hover tag/label&quot;. Try it with the two images above.</p>
<p>This gives new rhyme and reason for adding <em>meaningful</em> description image descriptions, i.e.</p>

589,2,2023-12-03T10:42:16.907,1,,"<p>As one of the Quintarchy of users that managed to get more than 10000 Rep here, and someone that was very active like 2 years ago I can tell you a tale that might exemplarify why migration <em>can</em> help, but doesn't happen a lot:</p>
<h2>A tale of 3 Printers</h2>
<p>My tale of 3D printing began with a silly question about <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/4849/how-do-i-3d-print-fair-dice"">perfect 3D printed dice.</a> Which, actually <strong>didn't</strong> star here: it was migrated from RPG.SE over here. It made me aware of the place. I made that question back then way before I had my own printer, but after a couple of material science classes that discussed pretty much the contents of the answer to the question and I tried to apply it to a hobby. It brought me to another hobby I would soon pick up: About christmas I bought my first printer, a TronXY X1. It was cheap, it was a tinker machine with a crazy wobbly gantry out of the box and I re-engineered <a href=""https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2275654"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a gantry slider</a> for it that turned out to act like a spring on itself and keep the gantry with a little load and thus straight. It was a project in itself. In July 2018 I finally took my step to buy an Ender 3. The version 1, but not the very first production run. I started to look up trying to get an inductive probe running, so I figured out <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6342/what-voltage-does-the-creality-ender-3-run-at"">voltage first</a>, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6358/inductive-sensor-in-24-v-machine"">then a setup</a>, and came to a hiccup: I needed to update Firmware.</p>
<p>That firmware update sent me down the drain: I had never worked with firmware before, and half the answers were very cryptic to me as a beginner. But I sat down with Greenonline in chat and we went on a deep dive into what actually was the board in the machine I bought, and how to actually install firmware on it. It was a crazy few days for me, and I learned more between the bouts of feeling overwhelmed and seeing some success and waiting for an arduino to actually flash the firmware! It led to a flurry of questions: starting by <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6399/recalibrating-home-position"">recalibrating</a>, trying to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6654/how-to-install-a-hex-firmware"">install hex firmware</a>, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6657/export-firmware-as-a-hex"">making my own hex file</a> for a modified firmware, and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6685/how-to-install-new-atmega-firmware-via-the-isp-pins"">flashing the board</a> before going full circle. Many of these questions would not be amiss on Adruino or Stack Overflow, but their context was always dealing with my printer.</p>
<p>The Ender3 had just about as hefty a learning curve as dealing with the mechanical wobble of the TronXY X1 at first. But I had this community (and chat) as my support. Why was the learnign curve so hefty? Well, the initial V1 was not good. It was cheap, it had problems. <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/6807/sudden-underextrusion-on-ender3"">Like the Z-endstop is from the factory misaligned,</a> I ruinied <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/7960/how-to-clean-up-my-build-plate-for-a-new-build-surface"">about 5 or such glue on surfaces</a>, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/8466/what-is-thermal-runaway-protection"">Thermal Runaway PRotection wasn't flashed by default</a>, the extriuder lever breaking could not be seen easily, leading me down to esoteric questions that to me now read like <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/10986/how-to-calculate-the-proper-layer-height-multiples"">&quot;Why the F... is my Layer height wrong?&quot;</a> and only some week after I noticed the break and got an aluminium replacement, firmware needed another upgrade to turn on <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/10571/how-to-activate-power-loss-recovery-in-marlin"">Power Loss recovery after the TRP upgrade did lack it</a> (though it never saw use - crazy stable power net here)...  I even started the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/knowledgebase"">Knowledgebase tag</a> to make some of the most common-appearing questions easily findable. A Hotend swap required <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/18720/how-to-properly-run-a-pid-tuning-and-update-the-firmware"">a PID Tune</a> (which I only documented about a year later!)...</p>
<p>And then my Ender3 v1 broke as I moved it. The extruder stepper driver just fizzled. So I bought an Ender3 V2, put it together but out of the box swapped the extruder for the aluminium one, and... I kind of realized that I had no more questions that I either hadn't learned or asked about previously and that the Ender3 V2 was out of the box and much more user-friendly. It just... <strong>worked</strong>. Sure, it does not come with mesh bed leveling, its firmware isn't perfect, but it just worked.</p>
<p>3D printing had changed <strong>so much</strong> over the years since I started as a 3rd generation hobbyist (as in: 1st Gen was Reprap, 2nd gen was parts kits, 3rd gen is early (ca pre-2019) printers and now... we are way deep in Gen 4 or 5 printers that actively build on the problems of their predecessors. The tech is much more mature, and I am much more knowledgeable.</p>
<h2>migration issue</h2>
<p>Now, my tale began with <strong>one</strong> migration. But that is an exception. We got a couple questions that were really ill fits. I helped to establish the benchmark test: &quot;Does the question claim that it's for 3D printing?&quot;. But often the questions have no clear target.</p>
<p>There's Blender, but most often that didn't fit. There's engineering, but often the question was not about either. In fact, most questions did not fit <strong>any</strong> stack we knew about.</p>

I can't think of any differences, off the top of my head - unless the former is about the software and the latter is the process. I see that <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> has no tag info, defining how the tag is <em>meant</em> to be used, whereas <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> <em>does</em> have a clear tag usage.</p>
<p>More importantly, leading on from that, are the tagged questions themselves tagged &quot;correctly&quot;?</p>
<p>Do the questions in the two tag groups have different leanings, i.e. those tagged <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> are more process oriented and those tagged <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> are more software oriented?</p>
</blockquote>
<hr />
<h4>At first look</h4>
<p>As stated in the question, there are currently 204 <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> questions and 6 <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> questions.</p>
<p>The missing tag info for <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> is easy to add - anyone can do so. I don't know why it wasn't added when the tag was added (more about this below, see <strong>Further Analysis</strong>).</p>
<p>Whilst having two tags <em>seems</em> to make sense, the questions should be checked to see that they have been tagged correctly (i.e. software or process oriented). This isn't an insurmountable task, although 204 is a bit of a chore. It's been done before, see the maker and model meta question, <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/q/430/4762"">Tag Maintenance Summer 2019</a>.</p>
<p>However, if while checking whether the questions <em>have</em> been tagged correctly,  it then becomes a bit of a headache actually distinguishing the questions correctly - that is to say, determining whether <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> or <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> (or even both!) applies - then maybe, one <em>should</em> be the synonym of the other.</p>
<h4>Further analysis</h4>
<p>Looking at the <em>dates</em> of the two groups of questions, it seems that <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> is actually a (relatively) recent tag, presumably introduced in May 2021 with this question, <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/16372/4762"">How to fix zits and blobs caused by Cura?</a> , which seems to be reasonable as the question is about Cura, rather than slicing, in general. However, I might be wrong in thinking this, I don't know - maybe <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> would have still be sufficient tag for this question, in which case, the whole <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> issue started with this question.</p>
<p><strong>However</strong>, further checking reveals that <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> was only added to <em>that</em> question, a month ago by <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/revisions/16372/3"">this edit</a>. So, really, this question could be retagged to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> without issue, as it has only had the (alleged) &quot;wrong&quot; tag for a few weeks.</p>
<p>That leaves 5 remaining <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> questions, and then the next oldest question tagged <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> is <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21705/4762"">Are there any slicers that use anti-aliasing (such as FXAA) for higher quality thumbnail generation?</a>, which is where and when the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> tag was introduced - 30 Nov 2023 - so it <em>really</em> is a late addition. Interestingly, the same user edited the previous, older question to add the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a>.</p>
<p>Again, this question could be considered to be about <em>slicers</em> rather than <em>slicing</em>, but whether that merits having a new tag, that could <em>potentially</em> cause endless confusion, and mis-tagging, down the line.</p>
<p><sub> The other four remaining questions were tagged as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> by their respective OPs, and while at least two of them (<a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/21735/4762"">Does FreeCAD produce a wrong stl for slicer software?</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22980/4762"">Effect of top thickness on print with bumps on top</a>) could be considered correctly tagged as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a>, IMHO moving them to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> wouldn't harm the questions. The other two (<a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/22846/4762"">Encountering some weird layer gaps on the last few lines of a particular print</a> and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/q/23008/4762"">Deformed 45 deg angle on outer wall</a>) look to have been incorrectly tagged, and <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> would be more appropriate.</sub></p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>: I have retagged these last four questions as <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a></p>
<h4>Was there a need for a new &quot;slicer&quot; tag?</h4>
<p>I would like to ask the OP, who introduced the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> tag, their reasoning for doing so, as well as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why no tag info was added for <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a>, in order to distinguish its use from that of <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a>?</li>
<li>Was the existing <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a> deemed not to be appropriate, if so, why not?</li>
</ul>
<p>I would suggest that we wait for an answer/response to those questions, before we even consider blatting the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> tag (or creating a synonym).</p>
<p>There may be a legitimate reason to have a distinct tag, especially if there is a need and desire to separate <em>software</em> from <em>process</em>.</p>
<h4>Moving forward</h4>
<p>It may be decided by the community that a distinction <em>is</em> required and hence the need for two tags.</p>
<p>However, if it is determined that there isn't a real need for a new tag, then we have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a synonym</li>
<li>Just re-tag the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> questions to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicing"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicing&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicing-tooltip-container"">slicing</a></li>
</ul>
<p>This latter option seems the easiest option and just returns everything to the way that they were prior to <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/questions/tagged/slicer"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" aria-label=""show questions tagged &#39;slicer&#39;"" rel=""tag"" aria-labelledby=""tag-slicer-tooltip-container"">slicer</a> having been introduced.</p>

<p>As the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">help</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You should only ask practical, answerable questions based on actual problems that you face. Chatty, open-ended questions diminish the usefulness of our site and push other questions off the front page.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, neither of your questions fit that criteria.</p>
<p>Therefore, the community voted to close.</p>
<p>Thereafter, any subsequent edits did not help the questions to address the initial reasons for closure (as explained more fully below)</p>
<hr />
<p>The first question about the medical applications, as I had already explained in the comments, was not suitable for a Q&amp;A site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would imagine that there are a number of on-going research projects. However, research across the various fields of medicine seems rather a broad area. As such, any comprehensive answer would need to be really long, and just a list of links to projects - a list that would be continually changing as time goes by. For that reason, it doesn't seem that your type of question is particularly suitable, as it currently stands, for this site - it is just too broad a question. If you could narrow the scope of the question (to a particular field) then that might make it easier to answer appropriately</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I then aggregated the links from a deleted answer, that appeared to answer your initial edit of your question, into a couple of comments, so that you could at least see them.</p>
<p>I then explained:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Maybe all of the links (and associated abstracts), in these comments, could be put into one single wiki-type answer that anyone could contribute to... that is a possibility. However, that would/could still result in a never-ending list answer that gets bigger and bigger and which would/could end up breaking Stack Exchange's Q&amp;A format. On the other hand, if multiple answers were posted, how could you select the accepted answer..?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I now realise that I mis-spoke when I said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you could narrow the scope of the question (to a particular field) then that might make it easier to answer appropriately</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the issue would still remain, regardless of scope - except that the list of linked papers would be a little shorter.</p>
<p>Apologies for having got your hopes up, and your futile scope edits.</p>
<hr />
<p>The second question was opinion based, <em>initially</em> asking about materials. Subsequent edits just <em>changed the subject upon which the opinion was asked</em>, from materials, to UX or UI (?), then to cost (for which you got a range of opinions in the comments), back to UX/UI and then finally an opinion on Octoprint. This last &quot;Octoprint&quot; edit contained a link to an unrelated product listing page (upon which octoprint was somewhere near the bottom), hence the spam flag.</p>
<hr />
<p>To re-iterate the <a href=""https://3dprinting.stackexchange.com/help/dont-ask"">help</a>, neither of these questions seem to be based on actual problems that you face, but rather the start of a <em>discussion</em>. Discussions are, unfortunately, out of scope of Stack Exchange, as a Q&amp;A site.</p>
<p><strong>Please also be aware that after a system-determined number of failed edits and re-open votes, the system (not the community or moderators) could implement a question ban or suspension. In order to avoid this, please try to ask <em>&quot;practical, answerable questions&quot;</em> and not opinion-based discussion based topics.</strong></p>
<p>Besides that if you continually edit the sense, or topic, of a question, then users will get confused, fatigued, or &quot;turned off&quot;, as some comments have indicated. So, please, try to plan your question in advance so that multiple subsequent edits aren't required.</p>
<p>If you really need an answer to your two questions, then I would like to quote <a href=""https://3dprinting.meta.stackexchange.com/a/181/4762"">this answer</a>, from a (sort of) related question:</p>
