[Your response to the second question you listed](http://academia.stackexchange.com/a/11358/4461) is a perfect example: for every ""around 4 weeks"" program, there are probably twenty that are much lower or higher, and depend on the advisor.

Using your example (and not to pick on you): trying to generalize the typical amount of vacation time by using a tiny sample size is misleading at best, and disingenuous at worst.  I completely agree that statistics are useful when they are used properly, but I would urge against trying to shoehorn statistics into answers for the sake of trying to be scientific about it.","","607","1"

"1997","929","02/08/2013 08:44:04","@ChrisGregg clearly a larger population would be better. In the absence of a large population survey, looking at a small sample of schools and their official policies is a much better answer than personal experience without any links to official policies. In the absence of a link to a survey I like the answer by F'x. While it is a small population it provides the insight into how to really get the answer.","","607","2"
"1998","4461","02/08/2013 09:32:30","@DanielE.Shub I disagree that it is a better answer -- it is misleading to assume that by looking at a few schools' policies you can get a general idea for vacation time, which is far, far more dependent on discussions with an individual advisor (and regardless of official policy). To ""really get the answer"" is to ask your advisor.  If you don't yet have an advisor or a school, then you need to either reach out ahead of time or start working on your persuasive skills for eventually talking to your advisor. That question is the perfect counterexample to your argument, IMHO.","","607","2"
"1999","4461","02/08/2013 09:38:13","@F'x Ah, but the key here is that *even at schools with a policy*, the policy is almost certainly deferential to your advisor's whim.  Quoting a policy someone put on a website actually does a *disservice* in this case. Academia is one place where there is so much leeway given to professors that I would argue it is more common to disregard the policy than to uphold it. I'm not disagreeing that there are lots of questions that benefit from data, but this example is (IMHO) one where it is not.","","607","2"

In fact, I think I might have hit upon something here.

The problems with comments is that they can only be deleted by the author or the moderators, which is why we need to have a clear policy on what to do with comments.

Of course, the author of the commented could have deleted it himself, so this is not only about moderating.

The problem with “You have been warned...again.” is not that it is precipitous but that it can be understood as an official warning (even if it was not intended as such).

Post 3k rep points, perhaps not so much. The psychological biases that people carry in voting (this post being an example) can potentially become a barrier to contributions. e.g. X saw a question that he could contribute to, something beyond the existing 5 answers, with the top answer at +40. We have a problem if X thinks ""_Why bother posting an answer, no one will bother reading past the top 2 answers. It will collect say 2-3 votes and will stay buried_"".","","4414","3"

In my early days on SE, I personally found this to be some sort of _rich-gets-richer_ system, and it was pretty discouraging.

This makes the question sound really silly. However, the question was not that. Let me explain.
Many people (me included) here are from maths and informatics. The way we (learned to) attack a problem starts with Step 0: Understand all definitions. So we start by looking up the definition of ""plagiarism"" and work with that.
However, many people do not so. If you ever taught a inteoductory math class, you will know the problem: The students have to solve an exercise which is virtually just looking","","4436","0"

Protecting questions reduces this problem. 3) Answers in comments from users that cannot answer a protected question are not a huge issue.

One reason for mod-hammering is to perform a quick action if needed and this was the case here: The question was clearly about evaluating and bashing an individual company, which no matter how much that company deserves it, clearly goes against a repeated community consensus.

The principal cause for it is often unrecognized by doctors: neurotoxins.  Lead, mercury, bismuth, arsenic, etc. impact the nervous system considerably and can be difficult to remove.  A person can be born with these toxins, but the ADHD is not a _genetic_ condition per se.  Chelation therapy can remove them, but it is often the case that they get purged from the body over time and people tend to outgrow the condition, which is why more focus is on younger people with it.","","5053","0"

It would be pointless. I could rephrase it to e.g. read ""How did the relevance of monographic dissertations change over the years?"", or ""Is the readership of monographic dissertations in steady decline and has it approached near zero?"" But that's just semanticts. It doesn't change the essence of my question or that of a potential answer. It doesn't change what I would like to know.","","5426","0"
